## Brief

### Introduction
Effective project initiation is a critical determinant of overall project success. As organizations adopt increasingly complex workflows involving diverse teams, remote work arrangements, and stringent compliance requirements, the need for intelligent, adaptive planning tools becomes paramount. This project aims to develop a semi-automated, AI-assisted software tool that streamlines pre-brief planning and scope definition for projects. The system will support project managers and team leaders in defining team roles, deadlines, task structures, and business value calculations, while intelligently drawing from historical data and optimizing team efficiency through informed suggestions and adaptive scheduling.
Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to create an intelligent planning tool that assists in the early-stage configuration of projects. This tool will guide users through the definition of team composition, high-level and granular task planning, prioritization, sprint scheduling, and value analysis. By integrating previous project data, machine learning capabilities, and a user-friendly interface, the system will enable smarter decisions at the planning stage and establish a strong foundation for downstream execution.

### Agile Workflow and Functional Capabilities

The planning process begins with project creation, where users initiate a new project record. Following this, team members are assigned based on several key attributes: job title, capabilities, availability (including time zones, holidays, and work-from-home status), and required data access or security level. This granular configuration enables the software to build an accurate model of team capacity and role coverage.
Once the team is formed, a deadline is proposed by the system using insights derived from previous similar projects. As project details evolve, the deadline is dynamically updated, providing users with a real-time reflection of project feasibility. A collaborative meeting is then conducted to define high-level tasks. At this stage, the software suggests templates for potential required tasks based on prior projects with similar characteristics. These templates come with tentative timelines that aim to facilitate timely completion of objectives.

The next phase involves the calculation of business value associated with each task. Team members may refer to suggested formulas and estimation methods within the tool to quantify the expected impact. Where needed, stakeholders can be consulted through integrated communication tools such as meeting notes or email summaries, which can also be stored as part of the projectâ€™s documentation. A formal document is generated during this process to outline the strategic value each task contributes to the business.

With value established, the task prioritization phase begins. Team leaders, assisted by the software, organize tasks in an optimal sequence. This ordering process considers multiple dimensions, including team member availability, skill alignment, quantitative value, regulatory constraints, and deadline proximity. The system performs multi-factor optimization to generate a recommended task order that aligns with business and operational goals.
Subsequently, tasks are decomposed into manageable subtasks by team members. The software provides intelligent suggestions based on historical decompositions of similar tasks, factoring in effort estimations and potential difficulties. This approach accelerates the breakdown process while maintaining quality and precision.
Sprint planning is then conducted, during which the tool automatically assigns subtasks to individuals for each sprint, organized by priority and workload balance. This ensures that team members are neither overburdened nor underutilized, and that high-value deliverables are targeted first.

### General System Capabilities

Beyond workflow support, the system includes a set of general capabilities that ensure robustness, traceability, and operational integrity. All documents, data, and communication are persistently linked to the project in a central repository, ensuring that project artifacts remain accessible and organized. A solid audit trail is made visible to IT and infrastructure teams, allowing for monitoring, review, and compliance checks.
The system also incorporates a built-in version control system (VCS) powered by a large language model (LLM), which automatically generates commit summaries, aiding in documentation and development transparency. Documentation is produced at defined checkpoints throughout the project lifecycle, with support for automated file management and dynamic directory structuring.
To support technical efficiency, the tool enables intelligent load balancing between active tasks or across employee machines. It leverages both central and virtual nodes, allowing for flexible resource allocation and optimal utilization of available computing or human resources.

### User Interaction and Software Intelligence

From the user's perspective, the system enables creation and management of new projects, assignment of team members with contextual metadata, and detailed configuration of tasks and subtasks. The software responds with data-driven suggestions, improves task decomposition efficiency, and supports intuitive sprint planning. Importantly, the user retains decision-making authority at every step, while the software augments human judgment with evidence-based recommendations.
From a technical standpoint, the software "learns" from historical data to offer deadline estimations, task templates, and prioritization logic. It automates repetitive documentation processes, facilitates compliance through traceability, and enables team leaders to make better-informed decisions early in the project lifecycle.

### Expected Outcomes

The project is expected to deliver a working prototype of the planning tool, complete with a user interface, backend data analysis components, and integration with task and document management modules. A comprehensive evaluation will be conducted, comparing manual and assisted planning approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Supporting documentation will include system design, user flow diagrams, and detailed explanations of the algorithms and heuristics used.
The final deliverable will be a full report outlining the methodology, system architecture, evaluation results, and potential enterprise applications. Recommendations will be made regarding scalability, integration into existing project management ecosystems, and opportunities for future enhancements, such as predictive scheduling or dynamic risk assessment.

### Conclusion

This project addresses a critical gap in pre-project planning by offering an intelligent solution that enhances both the efficiency and strategic alignment of project initiation activities. Through the integration of automation, historical analysis, and business logic, the proposed system provides a structured and forward-looking approach to scoping and planning. The outcome will not only support better project outcomes but also pave the way for more data-informed decision-making in project management practices.
