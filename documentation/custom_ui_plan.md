# Custom UI Plan for Agile Project Planning Software

## Features
- **Task Management**: Create, assign, and track tasks.
- **Sprint Planning**: Define sprints, allocate tasks, and set deadlines.
- **Reporting**: Generate progress reports, burndown charts, and team performance metrics.
- **Integration with "deepseek r1"**: Use the locally run LLM model to:
  - Generate insights from project data.
  - Provide natural language search capabilities.
  - Automate task prioritization based on input data.

## Architecture
### Frontend
- Framework: React.js for dynamic and responsive UI.
- Components: Task board, sprint planner, reporting dashboard, and LLM interaction panel.

### Backend
- Framework: Node.js with Express.js for API handling.
- Integration: REST API to communicate with "deepseek r1".

### Containerization
- Use Docker to containerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.
- Separate containers for frontend, backend, and "deepseek r1" model.

## Workflow
### User Interaction
- Users interact with the UI to manage tasks, plan sprints, and view reports.
- Users can input queries or commands for "deepseek r1" via a dedicated panel.

### LLM Integration
- Backend sends user queries to "deepseek r1".
- "deepseek r1" processes the input and returns insights or actions.

### Reporting
- Backend aggregates data and generates reports dynamically.

## Containerization
### Docker Setup
- Create Dockerfiles for frontend, backend, and "deepseek r1".
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate containers.
- Ensure network communication between containers.

## Deployment
### Local Deployment
- Run containers locally for development and testing.

### Production Deployment
- Optionally deploy on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure using Docker.
