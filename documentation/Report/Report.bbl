      \field{abstract}{Kanban is a well-known agile method first implemented in Toyota's manufacturing process in the 1950s, later spreading across various industries and academic fields. It focuses on process and project improvement in different fields and emphasizes a team's ability to improve the efficiency of day-to-day activities by implementing the core practices (e.g., visualizing workflow, limiting work-in-progress, managing flow). The efficiency of day-to-day activities is crucial in every process, yet, recent times have called for a new out-of-the-box approach to address the challenges companies face. While the literature review presents efficiency improvements through the use of the core practices, one of the biggest problems while implementing Kanban is shown to be the setting of effective work-in-progress limits. This article addresses this issue and proves that the workflow does not exclusively depend on the work-in-progress limits—as the core practices suggest—but on determining the optimal relationship (solution) among the replenishment value, resource capacity, and work-in-progress limits. Such an approach ensures that the workflow pace on the Kanban board is sustainable by reducing the number of work items in queues as well as people's idleness. The proposed empirical approach runs a series of simulation scenarios aimed at helping to identify the optimal relationship among the three mentioned elements for generating a sustainable workflow pace and minimizing work/people's idleness.}

      \field{abstract}{The paper is an analysis of the available project management methodologies from the standpoint of their applicability. Our aim is to establish specific characteristics of the today available methodologies (PMS, APM, PRINCE2, YUPMA, etc.) that can ensure realistic foundations on which an adequate methodology for a certain group of similar projects can be defined. The use of an adequate project management methodology brings a numerous advantages and benefits to project manager and project team and it shows them the right route towards project completion. This paper gives a review of the most recognizable methodologies proposed and implemented in the project management practice. Specific features of these methodologies were analysed bearing in mind the possibilities of implementation. It was found that general characteristics of traditional methodologies (PMI, IPMA, APM,YUPMA) make them more adequate to be implemented in larger and more complex projects such as: investment, military, manufacturing, overhaul, etc. projects. On the other hand, general characteristics of agile methodologies lead to a conclusion that these methodologies are more suitable to use for IT projects as well as for some smaller and less complex projects, such as devising various studies, project reports, etc. The research presented in this paper should be treated as a basis for further research oriented towards defining specific methodologies adequate for certain groups of similar projects.}

      \field{abstract}{Over recent years, the rising importance of knowledge work has prompted organizations to transition from traditional project management approaches to more collaborative methodologies. In today's globally connected environment, it is crucial for project managers to utilize a dynamic project management system that allows for swift and effective responses to emerging challenges and opportunities. Agile project management is recognized for its emphasis on decentralizing control and empowering team members to adapt to change. This article will explore and compare Agile Project Management with traditional project management techniques, highlighting historical practices and their relevance in the contemporary business landscape. Given the increasing complexity and unpredictability of today’s projects, Agile Project Management has proven to be an invaluable asset for both knowledge workers and the project managers who oversee their efforts. This document aims to encourage the adoption of agile methodologies within the corporate sector, providing a comprehensive outline of the approach.}

      \field{abstract}{The rules and practices for Scrum—a simple process for managing complex projects—are few, straightforward, and easy to learn. But Scrum’s simplicity itself—its lack of prescription—can be disarming, and new practitioners often find themselves reverting to old project management habits and tools and yielding lesser results. In this illuminating series of case studies, Scrum co-creator and evangelist Ken Schwaber identifies the real-world lessons—the successes and failures—culled from his years of experience coaching companies in agile project management. Through them, you’ll understand how to use Scrum to solve complex problems and drive better results—delivering more valuable software faster. Gain the foundation in Scrum theory—and practice—you need to: Rein in even the most complex, unwieldy projects Effectively manage unknown or changing product requirements Simplify the chain of command with self-managing development teams Receive clearer specifications—and feedback—from customers Greatly reduce project planning time and required tools Build—and release—products in 30-day cycles so clients get deliverables earlier Avoid missteps by regularly inspecting, reporting on, and fine-tuning projects Support multiple teams working on a large-scale project from many geographic locations Maximize return on investment!}

      \field{abstract}{The Agile project management methodology has been widely used in recent years as a means to counter the dangers of traditional, front-end planning methods that often lead to downstream development pathologies. Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{This study seeks to illuminate the managerial tensions inherent in implementing scaled agile (on the organizational, top management, middle management and team levels) and to frame these challenges within the broader context of project management.,The study adopts a grounded theory approach and delves into a qualitative dataset sourced from 34 interviews with subject matter experts actively engaged in scaling agile initiatives within large organizations spanning various industries. Additionally, the data have been enriched through a comprehensive literature review of the existing body of knowledge on scaling agile.,As a result of our investigation, we propose a framework of managerial tensions in scaling agile in large corporate settings and a series of research propositions and questions that may contribute significantly to the body of knowledge surrounding the phenomenon of “deprojectification” and propose agenda for the future studies in the field of project management.,The study also carries significant managerial implications. Firstly, based on the insights from the practice of scaling agile in large corporate setting, management can build awareness of the challenges inherent of transitioning to agile practices. This may help to anticipate the possible problems and proactively develop strategies how to address them. Secondly, management can be instructed about contingencies inherent in scaling agile, along with the potential disfunctions and side effects (unintended outcomes) that may emerge during the transition process. Thirdly, project management practitioners can gain insights on how scaling agile may cause shifts in the approach to managing projects, project team management and competencies that need to be developed to cope with environments where various approaches to managing projects coexist.,These insights can aid in the agile transition process, beginning with directing managerial attention toward contextual factors and progressing through potential challenges at the organizational, top management, middle management and team levels. Furthermore, the study highlights possible dysfunctionalities and side effects of scaling agile, shedding light on the “dark side” of agile.,The study contributes to the expansion of the empirical database on the implementation of agile practices in large organizational settings. It plays a role in defining and delineating the phenomenon of scaling agile within the context of project management and outlines a research agenda for future project management studies. Additionally, our study adds to the ongoing discourse surrounding the “deprojectification” effect that can occur during the scaling of agile. Lastly, it establishes connections between project management and software development literature regarding the implementation of agile at scale.}

      \field{abstract}{With the increasing scale of systems and products, many large companies ask different suppliers to manufacture the components of the final systems or products. Thus, managing projects dedicated to complex systems engineering is very tricky and ensuring the success of projects is a real issue. Many project management tools, techniques and even standards or guides have been developed by different organizations in order to support the management of such projects. For project managers, selecting and relying on immediately operational methods, tools and references (standards and guides) for a project manager to lead his project represents a true difficulty. The purpose of this paper is to introduce, analyze and compare the most famous project management references (PMBoK, ISO 21500 and ISO/IEC 29110) to provide a global and a detailed views on project management methodological guidelines, in order to facilitate the choice of a project management reference to help the project manager to manage the project effectively, thus to improve the success rate of projects.}
