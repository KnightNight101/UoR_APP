# TESTING.md

This document outlines test cases, performance thresholds, and rationales for each major featureset of the software project.

---

## 1. Authentication

**Test Cases:**
- Valid login with correct credentials
- Invalid login with wrong password
- Invalid login with non-existent user
- Password reset flow
- Session timeout and renewal
- Multi-factor authentication (if supported)
- Rate limiting on login attempts

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Login response time < 500ms
- Password reset email sent within 2s

**Rationale:**  
Authentication is critical for security and user experience. Tests ensure only authorized access, prevent brute-force attacks, and verify recovery mechanisms.

## 2. Project/Task Management

**Test Cases:**
- Create, update, delete project
- Create, update, delete task/subtask
- Assign tasks to users
- Change task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Task deadline enforcement
- Bulk task operations

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Task creation/update < 300ms
- Bulk operations (100 tasks) < 2s

**Rationale:**  
Project/task management is core functionality. Tests validate CRUD operations, assignment logic, and performance under load.

## 3. User/File Management

**Test Cases:**
- Add, update, delete user
- Assign roles/permissions
- Upload/download files
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Access control for files

**Performance Thresholds:**
- File upload/download < 1s for files <10MB
- User CRUD < 300ms

**Rationale:**  
Ensures robust user administration and secure, efficient file handling. Validates permission boundaries and data integrity.

## 4. Dashboard

**Test Cases:**
- Load dashboard with user-specific data
- Display project/task summaries
- Real-time updates (if supported)
- Widget rendering and refresh

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Dashboard load < 1s
- Widget refresh < 500ms

**Rationale:**  
Dashboards provide key insights. Tests confirm accurate, timely data presentation and responsiveness.

---

## 5. Collaboration

**Test Cases:**
- Real-time chat/message delivery
- Comment on tasks/projects
- Notification delivery
- Shared editing (if supported)
- Access control for collaborative features

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Message delivery < 300ms
- Notification delivery < 500ms

**Rationale:**  
Collaboration features drive productivity. Tests ensure reliability, speed, and correct access.

---

## 6. Security

**Test Cases:**
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS/CSRF protection
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Security checks on all endpoints
- Encryption/decryption < 100ms overhead

**Rationale:**  
Security tests protect user data and system integrity. They validate defenses against common threats.

---

## 7. Analytics

**Test Cases:**
- Data aggregation accuracy
- Report generation
- Export analytics data
- Filter/sort analytics views

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Report generation < 2s
- Data export < 5s for large datasets

**Rationale:**  
Analytics drive decision-making. Tests ensure correctness, completeness, and performance.

---

## 8. Enterprise Features

**Test Cases:**
- SSO integration
- API rate limiting
- Custom branding
- Advanced permission schemes
- Scalability under high load

**Performance Thresholds:**
- SSO login < 700ms
- System stable under 1000 concurrent users

**Rationale:**  
Enterprise features support large-scale deployments. Tests validate integration, customization, and scalability.
