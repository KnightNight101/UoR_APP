### Troubleshooting Quick Links

#### **Common Setup Issues**

**Backend Setup Problems:**
- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Database connection errors**: Run `python app/db.py` to initialize database
- **Port 5000 already in use**: Check for running processes with `lsof -ti:5000` (Mac/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :5000` (Windows)
- **Permission denied on database file**: Ensure proper file permissions or run with appropriate user privileges

**Frontend Setup Problems:**
- **`npm install` fails**: Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then retry
- **Build errors**: Run `npm run lint` to identify syntax errors
- **Port conflicts**: Vite automatically uses next available port, check terminal output for actual URL
- **Module resolution errors**: Verify all dependencies are installed and versions match package.json

**Docker Issues:**
- **Build failures**: Run `docker system prune` to clean cache, then rebuild with `--no-cache` flag
- **Container won't start**: Check logs with `docker logs <container-id>` for specific error messages
- **Volume mounting issues**: Ensure proper path syntax for your operating system
- **Permission issues**: Verify non-root user configuration in Dockerfile

#### **Quick Diagnostic Commands**

**System Health Checks:**
```bash
# Check Python environment
python --version && pip list | grep -E "flask|sqlalchemy"

# Check Node.js environment  
node --version && npm list --depth=0 | grep -E "react|vite"

# Test database connection
python -c "from app.db import engine; print(engine.execute('SELECT 1').scalar())"

# Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/user-count

# Check frontend build
cd ui && npm run build && echo "Build successful"
```

### FAQ Section

#### **General Questions**

**Q: What is the recommended deployment method for production?**  
**A:** Docker deployment with PostgreSQL database and nginx reverse proxy. See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete production setup procedures including SSL configuration and security hardening.

**Q: How do I migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL?**  
**A:** The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM which supports database abstraction. Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and run migration scripts provided in [`DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md).

**Q: Is the platform suitable for remote teams?**  
**A:** Yes, the platform is designed for distributed teams with web-based access, role-based permissions, and planned real-time collaboration features. Mobile responsiveness ensures access from various devices.

**Q: What are the licensing requirements?**  
**A:** This project is part of an academic development effort. Check with your institution's guidelines for usage and distribution policies.

#### **Technical Questions**

**Q: How do I add a new API endpoint?**  
**A:** Follow the pattern in [`app/api_server.py`](app/api_server.py). Add the route, implement the handler function, update [`API_DOCUMENTATION.md`](API_DOCUMENTATION.md), and write corresponding tests.

**Q: How do I add a new React component?**  
**A:** Create components in [`ui/src/components/`](ui/src/components/) for reusable elements or [`ui/src/pages/`](ui/src/pages/) for page-level components. Follow Material-UI theming patterns and include PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces.

**Q: How do I modify the database schema?**  
**A:** Update [`app/schema.sql`](app/schema.sql), create migration scripts, update SQLAlchemy models in [`app/db.py`](app/db.py), and document changes in [`DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md).

**Q: How do I enable HTTPS in development?**  
**A:** Use a reverse proxy like nginx or enable HTTPS in Vite configuration. Production deployment should use proper SSL certificates from a trusted certificate authority.

#### **Security Questions**

**Q: How are passwords secured?**  
**A:** Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with automatic salt generation. No plaintext passwords are stored in the database. See security implementation in [`app/db.py`](app/db.py).

**Q: What authentication methods are supported?**  
**A:** Currently username/password with planned JWT token support. The architecture supports integration with OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft) and SSO solutions for enterprise deployment.

**Q: How do I configure role-based permissions?**  
**A:** The database schema includes roles and permissions tables. Implement permission checking middleware in Flask and component-level access control in React components.
