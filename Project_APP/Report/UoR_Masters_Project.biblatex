  abstract = {Background The pressures on clinical time is a well-recognised obstacle to medical teaching in a busy department.1 The current novel Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged this even further by placing unprecedented demands on our time and ability to deliver face to face teaching.2 There is evidence demonstrating that teaching delivered in short units is well received by learners.3 4 Objectives To develop a new, quality-assured framework of teaching consisting of 15-minute virtual teaching sessions (Bitesize). They would be suitable for and accessible to all staff in a busy tertiary neonatal unit. Methods In the first phase, teaching sessions were delivered twice weekly with a focus on establishing routine and demonstrating how to deliver the teaching. After a period of 4 weeks, a survey was sent to participants. The sessions were then continued over a 6-month period with modifications incorporating feedback from the first survey. At the end of the 6-month period, another survey was sent to the participants for their feedback on Bitesize teaching.The sessions were open to all staff and was accessible on a virtual platform. Once completed, recorded sessions were uploaded to an online education platform. Results The initial survey was sent to 30 participants and 10 responded (33\%). As illustrated in table 1 below, there was a strong positive response to the sessions.View this table:View inline View popup Abstract 1453 Table 1 Positive feedback from initial bitesize sessions. There was emphasis on the relevance, as well as the practical and interactive nature of the sessionsIn order to promote inclusivity and make the sessions relevant to everyone, the sessions were delivered by various members of the team in the NICU including the c-onsultants, trainees and the extended multidisciplinary team as demonstrated in table 2 below.View this table:View inline View popup Abstract 1453 Table 2 The different roles of the Bitesize presenters. The MDT included nurses and nurse educators, a pharmacist, a Speech and Language therapist, physiotherapist and breastfeeding support specialists. Presenters who delivered more than one session were counted once.The response was positive even after 6 months. When asked what they liked about Bitesize, 78\% (n=11) highlighted the brevity of the sessions.Participants were asked if they would like Bitesize to continue (if staying in the NICU) or to be initiated in their new department (if rotating) and 100\% (n=14) said that they would. Conclusions Bitesize teaching is a valuable technique for delivering concise and relevant teaching in a busy department. The brevity promotes inclusivity of different team members and encourages the virtual participation fostered in the current pandemic climate. ReferencesAldeen Amer. Gisondi M.

  abstract = {Large Language models (LLMs) are finding wide use in software engineering practice. These models are extremely data-hungry, and are largely trained on open-source (OSS) code distributed with permissive licenses. In terms of actual use however, a great deal of software development still occurs in the for-profit/proprietary sphere, where the code under development is not, and never has been, in the public domain; thus, many developers, do their work, and use LLMs, in settings where the models may not be as familiar with the code under development. In such settings, do LLMs work as well as they do for OSS code? If not, what are the differences? When performance differs, what are the possible causes, and are there work-arounds? In this paper, we examine this issue using proprietary, closed-source software data from Microsoft, where most proprietary code is in C\# and C++. We find that performance for C\# changes little from OSS --{$>$} proprietary code, but does significantly reduce for C++; we find that this difference is attributable to differences in identifiers. We also find that some performance degradation, in some cases, can be ameliorated efficiently by in-context learning.},

The relationships are complex, but users are increasingly interested in finding how to balance a digital life with psychological wellbeing. We present an approach for investigating the relationship between lifestyle aspects and digital technology usage patterns that combines MindGauge, a mobile app enabling users collect and analyse their moods and behaviours, with a productivity tool (RescueTime). We then report a 16-month study in which we collected computer and smartphone usage and self-reports from 72 participants. We present methods for analysing the relationship between productivity, task-switching, mood and lifestyle, and more specifically how digital technology usage associates with productivity and task-switching. Our study also investigates how lifestyle aspects (sleep quality, physical activity, workload, social interaction and alcoholic drink consumption) relate to mood, task-switching and productivity. Results show that more frequent task-switching is associated with negative moods. A few lifestyle aspects, such as sleep quality and physical activity, had a significant relationship with positive moods. We also contribute a mood detection model that utilise both digital footprints and lifestyle contexts, yielding an accuracy of 87 percent. The study provides evidence that such methods can be used to understand the impact of technology on wellbeing.},

The companies that have strong alignment between the business strategy and the PM show successful projects outcome while the companies that have mismatch alignment show less successful projects outcome. , – The paper has investigated four telecommunications companies only. However, more companies will be better to compare the finding. Due to time constrains, the research has studied one project in each company. Each project was supporting one of the company's business strategies. More projects and business strategies will lead to clear picture of the alignment. Access to executives’ managers and CIO's was difficult. Several meetings were cancelled without short notice. , – This paper helps the companies to implement their business strategies with embedding their projects in the overall strategy. Also, helps the PM team to execute the projects in a strategic way. , – This paper contributes to the literature with a clear explanation of the concept of the alignment and provides a framework to ensure the alignment between the large PM process and the business strategy is achieved.},

The resulting impeded workflows negatively influence the efficiency with which goods or services are produced and delivered to customers. Within a healthcare context, impeded workflows can additionally have a negative impact on the safety and effectiveness of care delivered to patients. Methods This study evaluates the impact of an electronic health record system of a large university hospital on workflows of healthcare professionals from a lean management waste perspective. Workflow mismatches were identified from direct observations and follow-up semi-structured interviews with physicians and nurses and assessed in terms of waste generated. Results In total, 241 manifestations of waste were identified and classified according to 8 types of waste. Furthermore, noteworthy relationships among the identified manifestations of waste were found. These include differences in frequency per type of waste, certain types of waste having a cascading effect, and waste proliferating as a result of mimicked and routinized behavior. Conclusions The knowledge obtained from this study can support (re)design of IS to better match workflows which may subsequently lead to more safe, effective and efficient patient care.},

  abstract = {Everyday multitasking with electronic devices is common among all age groups, but the youngest generations of persons carry out the most everyday multitasking, especially in the form of media multitasking. Multitasking via technology in school settings or at home while studying is common for students. Both external factors (e.g., alerts from smartphones) and internal factors (e.g., thoughts about future online activities) influence multitasking prevalence. Although laboratory research has shown that performing concurrent tasks is subject to processing bottlenecks and to switch costs, real-life everyday multitasking is different from laboratory dual-task scenarios in several ways, including having more than two tasks involved, proceeding by interleaving tasks over extended periods of time, and allowing more flexibility in resource allocation and setting of priorities. Theoretically, everyday multitasking should be capable of achieving some processing efficiencies. Yet, empirical research shows that studying, doing homework, learning during lectures, learning from other sources, grades, and GPA likely are all negatively affected by concurrent multitasking with technology. Young people who frequently multitask compared with other young people may be poorer at ignoring irrelevant environmental information, but the effects of extreme multitasking on other cognitive outcomes are not clear-cut. There are strategies that people of all ages can use to minimize multitasking and reduce distractions when they are performing important tasks such as studying or doing homework.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) iteratively generate text token by token, with memory usage increasing with the length of generated token sequences. Since the request generation length is generally unpredictable, it is difficult to estimate the time and memory required to process requests, thus posing a challenge for effective request scheduling. Conventional sequence-level scheduling (SLS) serves requests in a first-come first-served (FCFS) manner with static batching where requests with short generation lengths are delayed until those with long ones have finished generation. Besides, to avoid out-of-memory (OOM) errors, SLS batches requests using a small batch size, which limits throughput. Recently proposed iteration-level scheduling (ILS) improves this with continuous batching, timely completing requests and dynamically adding new ones, but often limits the number of parallel-processing requests to OOM errors, thus compromising throughput. Moreover, both SLS and ILS fail to effectively balance workload across multiple LLM instances. To tackle these challenges, we propose slice-level scheduling (SCLS). By splitting the predefined maximal generation length limit into slices and serving batches slice by slice, it provides a precise range of serving time and memory usage for batched requests, laying the foundation for effective scheduling. Experiments confirm that compared with SLS and ILS schedulers, SCLS can improve throughput by up to 315.8\% and greatly mitigate load imbalance with proposed batching and offloading algorithms.},

  abstract = {This comprehensive review delves into the pivotal role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), from its inception in the 1950s to the emergence of advanced neural networks and deep learning architectures, has made a breakthrough in LLMs, with models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3, and in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with models such as CLIP and ALIGN. Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, which has emerged as a crucial technique to maximize the utility and accuracy of these models. This paper explores both foundational and advanced methodologies of prompt engineering, including techniques such as self-consistency, chain-of-thought, and generated knowledge, which significantly enhance model performance. Additionally, it examines the prompt method of VLMs through innovative approaches such as Context Optimization (CoOp), Conditional Context Optimization (CoCoOp), and Multimodal Prompt Learning (MaPLe). Critical to this discussion is the aspect of AI security, particularly adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in prompt engineering. Strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance model robustness are thoroughly reviewed. The evaluation of prompt methods is also addressed through both subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. This review also reflects the essential role of prompt engineering in advancing AI capabilities, providing a structured framework for future research and application.},

The reported study investigates multitasking in teams performing an experimental search and rescue task in Minecraft. The player in the team’s Transporter role is responsible for searching for victims and, after they have been triaged, transporting them to the appropriate location for evacuation. Player’s choices to switch tasks within and between task sets (searching vs. transporting) provide an opportunity to study interdependent task switching in the wild. That switching between task sets is more cognitively demanding than switching between tasks of the same type is well-documented. We find that an ACT-R estimate of average chunks in working memory is higher for teams that switch between task sets less frequently while scores are also higher.},

In this survey, we provide a systematic review of state-of-the-art research on LLM agents in education, categorizing them into two broad classes: (1) \textbackslash emph\{Pedagogical Agents\}, which focus on automating complex pedagogical tasks to support both teachers and students; and (2) \textbackslash emph\{Domain-Specific Educational Agents\}, which are tailored for specialized fields such as science education, language learning, and professional development. We comprehensively examine the technological advancements underlying these LLM agents, including key datasets, benchmarks, and algorithmic frameworks that drive their effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges such as privacy, bias and fairness concerns, hallucination mitigation, and integration with existing educational ecosystems. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological overview of LLM agents for education, fostering further research and collaboration to enhance their impact for the greater good of learners and educators alike.},

The idea of having every piece of information is increasingly tempting (and in safety critical domains often mandatory) but has become a potential obstacle for designers and operators. The present research study examined this challenge of appropriate information design and usability within a railway control setting. A laboratory study was conducted to investigate the presentation of different levels of information (taken from data processing framework, Dadashi et al. in Ergonomics 57(3):387–402, 2014) and the association with, and potential prediction of, the performance of a human operator when completing a cognitively demanding problem-solving scenario within railways. Results indicated that presenting users only with information corresponding to their cognitive task, and in the absence of other, non task-relevant information, improves the performance of their problem-solving/alarm handling. Knowing the key features of interest to various agents (machine or human) and using the data processing framework to guide the optimal level of information required by each of these agents could potentially lead to safer and more usable designs.},

  abstract = {Kanban is a well-known agile method first implemented in Toyota's manufacturing process in the 1950s, later spreading across various industries and academic fields. It focuses on process and project improvement in different fields and emphasizes a team's ability to improve the efficiency of day-to-day activities by implementing the core practices (e.g., visualizing workflow, limiting work-in-progress, managing flow). The efficiency of day-to-day activities is crucial in every process, yet, recent times have called for a new out-of-the-box approach to address the challenges companies face. While the literature review presents efficiency improvements through the use of the core practices, one of the biggest problems while implementing Kanban is shown to be the setting of effective work-in-progress limits. This article addresses this issue and proves that the workflow does not exclusively depend on the work-in-progress limits—as the core practices suggest—but on determining the optimal relationship (solution) among the replenishment value, resource capacity, and work-in-progress limits. Such an approach ensures that the workflow pace on the Kanban board is sustainable by reducing the number of work items in queues as well as people's idleness. The proposed empirical approach runs a series of simulation scenarios aimed at helping to identify the optimal relationship among the three mentioned elements for generating a sustainable workflow pace and minimizing work/people's idleness.},

Many different partitioning strategies have been developed, with great effectiveness in parallel applications. But the load-balancing problem is not yet solved completely; new applications and architectures require new partitioning features. Existing algorithms must be enhanced to support more complex applications. New models are needed for non-square, non-symmetric, and highly connected systems arising from applications in biology, circuits, and materials simulations. Increased use of heterogeneous computing architectures requires partitioners that account for non-uniform computing, network, and memory resources. And, for greatest impact, these new capabilities must be delivered in toolkits that are robust, easy-to-use, and applicable to a wide range of applications. In this paper, we discuss our approaches to addressing these issues within the Zoltan Parallel Data Services toolkit.},

The purpose of this paper is to examine the interrelations between firm/environment-related factors (training culture, management support, environmental dynamism and organizational climate), job-related factors (job environment, job autonomy, job communication) and employee-related factors (intrinsic motivation, skill flexibility, skill level, proactivity, adaptability, commitment) and their impact on EP.,A new research model that examines the relationships between these factors and EP is proposed utilizing the structural equation modeling approach.,The results indicate that job environment and management support have the strongest impacts (direct and indirect) on job performance, while adaptability and intrinsic motivation directly affect job performance.,A potential limitation of this research is that it is not focused only on one business sector (i.e. the sample is heterogeneous).,In this study, firm/environmental-related factors, job-related factors, employee-related factors and EP are incorporated in a single model using data from small- and medium-sized enterprises. Overall, the final model can explain 27 percent of EP variance (first-level analysis) and 42 percent of EP variance (second-level analysis).},

LLM-powered agents can provide timely interventions in collaborative conversations when a teacher is unable to assist the students. However, the use of LLMs in such tools raises many ethical questions and concerns, especially for use with young, impressionable populations. In this work, we present the human-centered design and evaluation of an LLM-based agent aimed to facilitate small group collaboration in middle- and high-school classrooms. Fifty-eight groups of dyads and triads (145 participants), aged 12-17, collaborated in a jigsaw activity and were assigned to be assisted by our agent or not. The results showed decreased self-reported ratings of social loafing and increased use of language related to respectful collaboration in interactions with the agent compared to those without.},

Assistants have become prevalent in the past decade, and users have been taking services from assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana.The emergence of AR/VR devices raised many new challenges for building intelligent assistants. The unique requirements have inspired new research directions such as (a) understanding users' situated multi-modal contexts (e.g. vision, sensor signals) as well as language-oriented conversational contexts, (b) personalizing the assistant services by grounding interactions on growing public and personal knowledge graphs and online search engines, and (c) on- device model inference and training techniques that satisfy strict resource and privacy constraints.In this tutorial, we will provide an in-depth walk-through of techniques in the afore-mentioned areas in the recent literature. We aim to introduce techniques for researchers and practitioners who are building intelligent assistants, and inspire research that will bring us one step closer to realizing the dream of building an all-day accompanying assistant. Additionally, we will highlight the significant role that Large Language Models (LLMs) play in enhancing these strategies, underscoring their potential to reshape the future landscape of intelligent assistance.},

Making size estimation of product backlog items correctly is one of the most prominent factors for effective sprint planning. Retrospective meetings are an opportunity for teams to improve product quality, their productivity, and estimation capability. Enhancing in those areas requires empiricism as agility requires; hence, measureable indicators should be inspected and adapted at regular intervals. In this study, we assessed how and what kind of historical data is required to be collected for monitoring, and how statistical analysis can be investigated for inspection and adaptation in retrospective meetings. We experimented that statistics of “Correlation between Story Point and Actual Effort” and “Consistency of Relative Estimation” were convenient for inspection and adaptation of estimation capability of teams. Past retrospective meetings also showed that statistics of “Team's Actual Effort on Product,” “Team Velocity,” “Actual Effort for One Story Point,” “Innovation Rate,” and “Velocity vs Unplanned Effort Rate” were helpful to control and increase the productivity of teams. “Actual Effort Rate of Quality Activities” and “Subcomponent Defect Density” statistical results helped to enhance product quality.},

  abstract = {The fast rise of cloud computing during the last decade promised flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, for an increasing number of businesses, the long-term realities of cloud computing are requiring significant rethinking. According to recent studies, 42\% of US businesses have already moved at least half of their cloud workloads back on-premises or are planning to do so. The rising trend of "Cloud Exit" requires a thorough analysis of the cloud's disadvantages in comparison to its widely promoted benefits. Multiple critical variables are driving the shift away from total cloud reliance. Although transitioning to the cloud initially reduces building costs, subsequent operational expenses may ultimately surpass those of private data centers. A 2022 poll revealed that 43\% of IT leaders perceive the expenses associated with transitioning to the cloud as exceeding their initial expectations. Companies often contend with overprovisioning and surplus resources, resulting in unnecessary expenses. Simultaneously, notable cloud breaches at Capital One, Twilio, and others heighten apprehensions regarding the storage of sensitive data externally. Outages at AWS, Azure, and Oracle underscore dependence hazards. The Cloud Exit trend points to the need of a more balanced viewpoint. Although early adoption rates of clouds are strong, current polls reveal just 32\% of corporate cloud migrations are judged totally effective. The gap between the promised outcomes and real-world results suggests cloud computing has been overhyped. Its purported security, reliability, and cost advantages do not universally apply. Moreover, concentration among the "Big Three" cloud providers allows AWS, Azure, and Google inordinate influence over pricing, service terms, and the direction of innovation. Their supremacy and exclusive ecosystems progressively confine users, while unjustly disadvantaging third-party services. Consequently, an increasing number of firms are formulating Cloud Exit strategies to diminish external dependence, reclaim control, and manage dangers. The cloud necessitates ongoing assessment to maintain its competitive and financial viability over time, rather than being a universal solution. Preparedness to shift workloads off-cloud gives firms strategic flexibility. Rather than a one-way path, the cloud requires continuous reassessment. Exit is not failure, but strategic agility retaining on-premises control. With unchecked dependence, dominance and deviation from early claims, businesses are wise to temper cloud enthusiasm with realism. Maintaining hybrid flexibility and an exit strategy avoids innovation stagnation or lock-in. The cloud comedown does not negate its potential, only refocuses usage based on actual outcomes.},

In this paper we formalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that, given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, produces a multi-sprint optimal plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. To cope with the inherent flexibility and uncertainty of agile projects, our approach ensures that a baseline plan can be revised and re-optimized during project execution without disrupting it, which we call smooth replanning. The planning problem is converted into a generalized assignment problem, given a linear programming formulation, and solved using the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer. Our model is validated on both real and synthetic projects. In particular, a case study on two real projects confirms the effectiveness of our approach; as to efficiency, for medium-sized problems an exact solution is found in a few minutes, while for large problems a heuristic solution that is less than 1\% far from the exact one is returned in a few seconds. Finally, some smooth replanning tests investigate the trade-off between plan quality and stability.},

  abstract = {In a large industry project that followed an agile approach based on the Scrum method, we found that the team often struggled with breaking coarse product backlog items down into the detailed tasks that had to be completed in a sprint. The team's understanding of the backlog items' business and technical implications and dependencies seemed not deep enough to identify all necessary tasks, so in addition to the tasks defined in the sprint planning meeting prescribed by Scrum, an average of 26\% of additional tasks was identified later over the course of each sprint, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management very difficult. To counter this effect and support the team's understanding of backlog items right from the beginning of each sprint, we introduced a pragmatic method to analyze backlog items more comprehensively and thus support a more complete and reliable task breakdown. We consequently found that the effectiveness and precision of task breakdowns has improved significantly in the project.},

  abstract = {While intelligent virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have become ubiquitous in modern life, they still face limitations in their ability to follow multi-step instructions and accomplish complex goals articulated in natural language. However, recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) show promise for overcoming existing barriers by enhancing natural language processing and reasoning capabilities. Though promising, applying LLMs to create more advanced virtual assistants still faces challenges like ensuring robust performance and handling variability in real-world user commands. This paper proposes a novel LLM-based virtual assistant that can automatically perform multi-step operations within mobile apps based on high-level user requests. The system represents an advance in assistants by providing an end-to-end solution for parsing instructions, reasoning about goals, and executing actions. LLM-based Process Automation (LLMPA) has modules for decomposing instructions, generating descriptions, detecting interface elements, predicting next actions, and error checking. Experiments demonstrate the system completing complex mobile operation tasks in Alipay based on natural language instructions. This showcases how large language models can enable automated assistants to accomplish real-world tasks. The main contributions are the novel LLMPA architecture optimized for app process automation, the methodology for applying LLMs to mobile apps, and demonstrations of multi-step task completion in a real-world environment. Notably, this work represents the first real-world deployment and extensive evaluation of a large language model-based virtual assistant in a widely used mobile application with an enormous user base numbering in the hundreds of millions.},

However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this article, we propose a specialized psychological LLM, named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multiturn dialogues, and knowledge-based QA. Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multiturn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared with other LLMs.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are being used as ad-hoc therapists. Research suggests that LLMs outperform human counselors when generating a single, isolated empathetic response; however, their session-level behavior remains understudied. In this study, we compare the session-level behaviors of human counselors with those of an LLM prompted by a team of peer counselors to deliver single-session Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Our three-stage, mixed-methods study involved: a) a year-long ethnography of a text-based support platform where seven counselors iteratively refined CBT prompts through self-counseling and weekly focus groups; b) the manual simulation of human counselor sessions with a CBT-prompted LLM, given the full patient dialogue and contextual notes; and c) session evaluations of both human and LLM sessions by three licensed clinical psychologists using CBT competence measures. Our results show a clear trade-off. Human counselors excel at relational strategies -- small talk, self-disclosure, and culturally situated language -- that lead to higher empathy, collaboration, and deeper user reflection. LLM counselors demonstrate higher procedural adherence to CBT techniques but struggle to sustain collaboration, misread cultural cues, and sometimes produce "deceptive empathy," i.e., formulaic warmth that can inflate users' expectations of genuine human care. Taken together, our findings imply that while LLMs might outperform counselors in generating single empathetic responses, their ability to lead sessions is more limited, highlighting that therapy cannot be reduced to a standalone natural language processing (NLP) task. We call for carefully designed human-AI workflows in scalable support: LLMs can scaffold evidence-based techniques, while peers provide relational support. We conclude by mapping concrete design opportunities and ethical guardrails for such hybrid systems.},

Load balancing is a key aspect of cloud computing and avoids the situation in which some nodes become overloaded while the others are idle or have little work to do. Load balancing can improve the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, including response time, cost, throughput, performance and resource utilization. In this paper, we study the literature on the task scheduling and load-balancing algorithms and present a new classification of such algorithms, for example, Hadoop MapReduce load balancing category, Natural Phenomena-based load balancing category, Agent-based load balancing category, General load balancing category, application-oriented category, network-aware category, and workflow specific category. Furthermore, we provide a review in each of these seven categories. Also. We provide insights into the identification of open issues and guidelines for future research.},

  abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) workloads consist of distinct prefill and decode phases, each with unique compute and memory requirements that should be considered when routing input queries across cluster instances. However, existing load-balancing algorithms treat these workloads as monolithic jobs, ignoring the differences between the two phases. This oversight leads to suboptimal query distribution and increased response latency. In our work, we first characterize the factors affecting response latency during LLM inference. We show that balancing inference requests across available LLM instances can improve end-to-end latency more than simply optimizing the instance-level scheduler. Motivated by these findings, we propose a heuristic-guided, reinforcement learning-based router for data-driven, workload-aware scheduling. Our router distributes queries across LLM instances by using a trainable response-length predictor and a novel formulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads, achieving over 11\% lower end-to-end latency than existing methods on mixed public datasets. Our framework represents a first step toward a holistic optimization framework and serves as a benchmark for deriving optimal load balancing strategies tailored to different reward functions and requirements. Beyond latency, we can extend the proposed framework to optimize for various performance criteria ensuring that the system meets diverse operational objectives.},

Our aim is to establish specific characteristics of the today available methodologies (PMS, APM, PRINCE2, YUPMA, etc.) that can ensure realistic foundations on which an adequate methodology for a certain group of similar projects can be defined. The use of an adequate project management methodology brings a numerous advantages and benefits to project manager and project team and it shows them the right route towards project completion. This paper gives a review of the most recognizable methodologies proposed and implemented in the project management practice. Specific features of these methodologies were analysed bearing in mind the possibilities of implementation. It was found that general characteristics of traditional methodologies (PMI, IPMA, APM,YUPMA) make them more adequate to be implemented in larger and more complex projects such as: investment, military, manufacturing, overhaul, etc. projects. On the other hand, general characteristics of agile methodologies lead to a conclusion that these methodologies are more suitable to use for IT projects as well as for some smaller and less complex projects, such as devising various studies, project reports, etc. The research presented in this paper should be treated as a basis for further research oriented towards defining specific methodologies adequate for certain groups of similar projects.},

  abstract = {When working on a large software system, a programmer typically spends an inordinate amount of time sifting through thousands of artifacts to find just the subset of information needed to complete an assigned task. All too often, before completing the task the programmer must switch to working on a different task. These task switches waste time as the programmer must repeatedly find and identify the information relevant to the task-at-hand. In this paper, we present a mechanism that captures, models, and persists the elements and relations relevant to a task. We show how our task context model reduces information overload and focuses a programmer's work by filtering and ranking the information presented by the development environment. A task context is created by monitoring a programmer's activity and extracting the structural relationships of program artifacts. Operations on task contexts integrate with development environment features, such as structure display, search, and change management. We have validated our approach with a longitudinal field study of Mylar, our implementation of task context for the Eclipse development environment. We report a statistically significant improvement in the productivity of 16 industry programmers who voluntarily used Mylar for their daily work.},

  abstract = {Knowledge creation in education is a critical practice for advancing collective knowledge and fostering innovation within a student community. Students play vital roles in identifying gaps and collaborative work to improve community ideas from discourse, but idea quality can be suboptimal, affected by a lack of resources or diversity of ideas. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence and large language models (LLMs) in education has allowed work on idea-centric discussions to advance in ways that were previously unfeasible. However, the use of LLMs requires specific skill sets in prompt engineering, relevant to the in-context technique known as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generating and supporting improvable ideas in student discourse. A total of 721 discourse turns consisting of 272 relevant question–answer pairs and 149 threads of student discourse data were collected from 31 students during a two-day student Knowledge Building Design Studio (sKBDS). Student responses were augmented using the CoT approach and the LLM-generated responses were compared with students’ original responses. Findings are illustrated using two threads to show that CoT-augmented inputs for the LLMs can generate responses that support improvable ideas in the context of knowledge creation. This study presents work from authentic student discourse and has implications for research and classroom practice.},

To address these challenges, researchers have explored optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache within LLMs. However, existing approaches have not considered the potential benefits of sharing KV caches across multiple requests in a cluster environment. Addressing this gap, we introduce sLLM, a novel system that integrates an efficient shared-memory-based Semantic Load Balancer with a KV cache sharing mechanism. This design significantly reduces the need for recomputation during LLM inference, which enhances inference performance. Our evaluation of the sLLM system showcases its effectiveness: the Semantic Load Balancer achieves up to a 7× reduction in latency when dispatching requests, while the system as a whole can decrease the Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for LLM inferences by 30 – 58\%.},

  abstract = {Current developments in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive zero-shot capabilities across various natural language tasks. An interesting application of these systems is in the automated assessment of natural language generation (NLG), a highly challenging area with great practical benefit. In this paper, we explore two options for exploiting the emergent abilities of LLMs for zero-shot NLG assessment: absolute score prediction, and comparative assessment which uses relative comparisons between pairs of candidates. Though comparative assessment has not been extensively studied in NLG assessment, we note that humans often find it more intuitive to compare two options rather than scoring each one independently. This work examines comparative assessment from multiple perspectives: performance compared to absolute grading; positional biases in the prompt; and efficient ranking in terms of the number of comparisons. We illustrate that LLM comparative assessment is a simple, general and effective approach for NLG assessment. For moderate-sized open-source LLMs, such as FlanT5 and Llama2-chat, comparative assessment is superior to prompt scoring, and in many cases can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that LLMs often exhibit strong positional biases when making pairwise comparisons, and we propose debiasing methods that can further improve performance.},

  abstract = {Workplace social media platforms enable employees to cultivate their professional image and connect with colleagues in a semi-formal environment. While semi-formal corporate communication poses a unique set of challenges, large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in helping users draft and edit their social media posts. However, LLMs may fail to capture individualized tones and voices in such workplace use cases, as they often generate text using a "one-size-fits-all" approach that can be perceived as generic and bland. In this paper, we present Corporate Communication Companion (CCC), an LLM-empowered interactive system that helps people compose customized and individualized workplace social media posts. Using need-finding interviews to motivate our system design, CCC decomposes the writing process into two core functions, outline and edit: First, it suggests post outlines based on users' job status and previous posts, and next provides edits with attributions that users can contextually customize. We conducted a within-subjects user study asking participants both to write posts and evaluate posts written by others. The results show that CCC enhances users' writing experience, and audience members rate CCC-enhanced posts as higher quality than posts written using a non-customized writing assistant. We conclude by discussing the implications of LLM-empowered corporate communication.},

  abstract = {To overcome the ever-growing demand for software, software development organizations strive to enhance the productivity of their developers. But what does productivity mean in the context of software development? A substantial amount of work on developer productivity has been undertaken over the past four decades. The majority of this work considered productivity from a top-down perspective (the manager view) in terms of the artifacts and code created per unit of time. Common examples of such productivity measures are the lines of source code modified per hour, the resolution time for modification requests, or function points created per month. These productivity measures focus on a single, output-oriented factor for quantifying productivity, and do not take into account developers’ individual work roles, practices and other factors that might affect their productivity, such as work fragmentation, the tools used, or the work/office environment. In our research, we investigated how productivity could be quantified from the bottom-up, following a mixed-methods approach that involved more than 800 software developers. By investigating developers’ individual productivity, it is possible to better understand the individual work habits and patterns, how they relate to the productivity perceptions and also which factors are most relevant for a developer’s productivity.},

Although there is a large body of research about measuring and investigating productivity from an organizational point of view, there is a paucity of research about how software developers, those at the front-line of software construction, think about, assess and try to improve their productivity. To investigate software developers' perceptions of software development productivity, we conducted two studies: a survey with 379 professional software developers to help elicit themes and an observational study with 11 professional software developers to investigate emergent themes in more detail. In both studies, we found that developers perceive their days as productive when they complete many or big tasks without significant interruptions or context switches. Yet, the observational data we collected shows our participants performed significant task and activity switching while still feeling productive. We analyze such apparent contradictions in our findings and use the analysis to propose ways to better support software developers in a retrospection and improvement of their productivity through the development of new tools and the sharing of best practices.},

  abstract = {Many software development organizations strive to enhance the productivity of their developers. All too often, efforts aimed at improving developer productivity are undertaken without knowledge about how developers spend their time at work and how it influences their own perception of productivity. To fill in this gap, we deployed a monitoring application at 20 computers of professional software developers from four companies for an average of 11 full work day in situ. Corroborating earlier findings, we found that developers spend their time on a wide variety of activities and switch regularly between them, resulting in highly fragmented work. Our findings extend beyond existing research in that we correlate developers' work habits with perceived productivity and also show productivity is a personal matter. Although productivity is personal, developers can be roughly grouped into morning, low-at-lunch and afternoon people. A stepwise linear regression per participant revealed that more user input is most often associated with a positive, and emails, planned meetings and work unrelated websites with a negative perception of productivity. We discuss opportunities of our findings, the potential to predict high and low productivity and suggest design approaches to create better tool support for planning developers' work day and improving their personal productivity.},

Karin Moser’s article, ‘Only a click away’, illustrates how even the tiniest matters – such as etiquette, forms of address and degrees of informality – can have significant effects. Outlining the differences between on-site and dispersed teams, Moser shows how norms of behaviour are unconsciously formed and maintained by people who meet face-to-face regularly and argues that different approaches must be actively implemented when developing dispersed teams.

Code comments and documentation can help, but are typically scarce or hard to navigate. Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the process of writing code. Can they do the same for helping understand it? In this study, we provide a first investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI built directly in the IDE that is geared towards code understanding. Our IDE plugin queries OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model with four high-level requests without the user having to write explicit prompts: to explain a highlighted section of code, provide details of API calls used in the code, explain key domain-specific terms, and provide usage examples for an API. The plugin also allows for open-ended prompts, which are automatically contextualized to the LLM with the program being edited. We evaluate this system in a user study with 32 participants, which confirms that using our plugin can aid task completion more than web search. We additionally provide a thorough analysis of the ways developers use, and perceive the usefulness of, our system, among others finding that the usage and benefits differ between students and professionals. We conclude that in-IDE prompt-less interaction with LLMs is a promising future direction for tool builders.},

Traditional Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, have revolutionised software development practices but face scalability issues and struggle to adapt to rapid technological changes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes integrating DevOps practices, incorporating Lean principles, adopting hybrid Agile methodologies, and emphasising continuous feedback and iterative learning. These enhancements aim to streamline development processes, eliminate waste, tailor Agile practices to specific needs, and foster a culture of continuous improvement. The potential impact of these enhancements on improving efficiency and outcomes in high-tech software development projects is significant. However, further research and experimentation are needed to validate their effectiveness in real-world settings. Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential for organisations to stay competitive in the ever-evolving landscape of high-tech industries.},

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  abstract = {Multitasking is all around us: the office worker interrupted by a phone call, the teenager texting while driving, the salesperson chatting while entering an order. When multitasking, the mind juggles all the many tasks we're doing this second, this hour, this week, and tries to perform them together-sometimes with great ease, sometimes with great difficulty. We don't often stop to think about how exactly we accomplish these feats of multitasking great and small. How do we switch from one task to another? What types of multitasking are disruptive, and when are they most disruptive? And ultimately, how can we take advantage of the benefits of multitasking while alleviating its negative effects in our daily lives? This book presents the theory of threaded cognition, a theory that aims to explain the multitasking mind. The theory states that multitasking behavior can be expressed as cognitive threads-independent streams of thought that weave through the mind's processing resources to produce multitasking behavior, and sometimes experience conflicts to produce multitasking interference. Grounded in the ACT-R cognitive architecture, threaded cognition incorporates computational representations and mechanisms used to simulate and predict multitasking behavior and performance. The book describes the implications of threaded cognition theory across three traditionally disparate domains: concurrent multitasking (doing multiple tasks at once), sequential multitasking (interrupting and resuming tasks), and multitask skill acquisition (learning and practicing multiple tasks). The work stresses the importance of unifying basic and applied research by alternating between in-depth descriptions of basic research phenomena and broader treatments of phenomena in applied domains, such as driver distraction and human-computer interaction. The book also includes practical guidelines for designers of interactive systems intended for multitasking contexts.},

  abstract = {The Agile project management methodology has been widely used in recent years as a means to counter the dangers of traditional, front-end planning methods that often lead to downstream development pathologies. Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

Yet, recent advances in generative AI may change this situation through new forms of human-AI collaboration. This paper investigates how teams of players interact with an AI assistant in the PIRCC game Codenames and the impact this has on cognition, social dynamics, and player experience. We observed gameplay and conducted post-game focus groups with 54 participants across ten groups. Each group played three rounds of Codenames, with an AI assistant supporting Cluegivers. We found the AI assistant enhanced players' convergent and divergent thinking, but interfered with formation of team mental models, highlighting a tension in the use of AI in creative team scenarios. The presence of the AI challenged many players' understanding of the 'spirit of the game'. Furthermore, the presence of the AI assistants weakened social connections between human teammates, but strengthened connections across teams. This paper provides an empirical account of an AI assistant's effect on cognition, social dynamics, and player experience in Codenames. We highlight the opportunities and challenges that arise when designing hybrid digital boardgames that include AI assistants.},

  abstract = {This study seeks to illuminate the managerial tensions inherent in implementing scaled agile (on the organizational, top management, middle management and team levels) and to frame these challenges within the broader context of project management.,The study adopts a grounded theory approach and delves into a qualitative dataset sourced from 34 interviews with subject matter experts actively engaged in scaling agile initiatives within large organizations spanning various industries. Additionally, the data have been enriched through a comprehensive literature review of the existing body of knowledge on scaling agile.,As a result of our investigation, we propose a framework of managerial tensions in scaling agile in large corporate settings and a series of research propositions and questions that may contribute significantly to the body of knowledge surrounding the phenomenon of “deprojectification” and propose agenda for the future studies in the field of project management.,The study also carries significant managerial implications. Firstly, based on the insights from the practice of scaling agile in large corporate setting, management can build awareness of the challenges inherent of transitioning to agile practices. This may help to anticipate the possible problems and proactively develop strategies how to address them. Secondly, management can be instructed about contingencies inherent in scaling agile, along with the potential disfunctions and side effects (unintended outcomes) that may emerge during the transition process. Thirdly, project management practitioners can gain insights on how scaling agile may cause shifts in the approach to managing projects, project team management and competencies that need to be developed to cope with environments where various approaches to managing projects coexist.,These insights can aid in the agile transition process, beginning with directing managerial attention toward contextual factors and progressing through potential challenges at the organizational, top management, middle management and team levels. Furthermore, the study highlights possible dysfunctionalities and side effects of scaling agile, shedding light on the “dark side” of agile.,The study contributes to the expansion of the empirical database on the implementation of agile practices in large organizational settings. It plays a role in defining and delineating the phenomenon of scaling agile within the context of project management and outlines a research agenda for future project management studies. Additionally, our study adds to the ongoing discourse surrounding the “deprojectification” effect that can occur during the scaling of agile. Lastly, it establishes connections between project management and software development literature regarding the implementation of agile at scale.},

Well, it is easy to understand that the speed of communication, travel and methods of transfer of speech and data have improved with innovative Technology, but the question is, are we allowing enough time at the receiving or sending end to complete or comprehend a message. But some other researchers are calling the whole thing a bluff. Hence the selection of the present topic to find out the reality of the situation.},

  abstract = {An important problem in program development and maintenance is version control, i.e. the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized. The Revision Control System (RCS) is a software tool that assists with that task. RCS manages revisions of text documents, in particular source programs, documentation, and test data. It automates the storing, retrieval, logging and identification of revisions, and it provides selection mechanisms for composing configurations. This paper introduces basic version control concepts and discusses the practice of version control using RCS. For conserving space, RCS stores deltas, i.e. differences between successive revisions. Several delta storage methods are discussed. Usage statistics show that RCS's delta method is space and time efficient. The paper concludes with a detailed survey of version control tools.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of media multitasking among youth has raised concerns regarding its negative effects on youths’ functioning. Although the number of empirical studies on the consequences of media multitasking for youth has grown rapidly, there has been no attempt to integrate theory with the results of these studies. This review integrates available findings on the relationship between media multitasking and three domains of youths’ functioning: cognitive control, academic performance, and socioemotional functioning. Three databases (PsycINFO, ERIC, and CMMC) were searched to identify relevant studies, resulting in 8448 citations. Fifty-six studies met the inclusion criteria: nine studies on cognitive control, 43 on academic performance, and four on socioemotional functioning. Overall, the findings indicate a small to moderate negative relationship between media multitasking and the three domains of youths’ functioning. However, evidence regarding the causal direction of this relationship is lacking. Based on the included studies, we identify several research gaps and present five main directions for future research: examining causality, establishing more targeted theories, improving media multitasking measurements, focusing on individual and contextual differences, and including representative samples.},

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of large language model (LLM) fine-tuning by integrating hermeneutic theories of human comprehension, with a focus on the essential cognitive conditions that underpin this process. Drawing on Gadamer’s concepts of Vorverständnis, Distanciation, and the Hermeneutic Circle, the paper explores how LLM fine-tuning evolves from initial learning to deeper comprehension, ultimately advancing toward self-awareness. It examines the core principles, development, and applications of fine-tuning techniques, emphasizing its growing significance across diverse field and industries. The paper introduces a new term, “Tutorial Fine-Tuning (TFT)”, which annotates a process of intensive tuition given by a “tutor” to a small number of “students”, to define the latest round of LLM fine-tuning advancements. By addressing key challenges associated with fine-tuning, including ensuring adaptability, precision, credibility and reliability, this paper explores potential future directions for the co-evolution of humans and AI. By bridging theoretical perspectives with practical implications, this work provides valuable insights into the ongoing development of LLMs, emphasizing their potential to achieve higher levels of cognitive and operational intelligence.},

  abstract = {While LLMs have made it possible to rapidly prototype new ML functionalities, many real-world applications involve complex tasks that cannot be easily handled via a single run of an LLM. Recent work has found that chaining multiple LLM runs together (with the output of one step being the input to the next) can help users accomplish these more complex tasks, and in a way that is perceived to be more transparent and controllable. However, it remains unknown what users need when authoring their own LLM chains – a key step to lowering the barriers for non-AI-experts to prototype AI-infused applications. In this work, we explore the LLM chain authoring process. We find from pilot studies that users need support transforming data between steps of a chain, as well as debugging the chain at multiple granularities. To address these needs, we designed PromptChainer, an interactive interface for visually programming chains. Through case studies with four designers and developers, we show that PromptChainer supports building prototypes for a range of applications, and conclude with open questions on scaling chains to even more complex tasks, as well as supporting low-fi chain prototyping.},

In this work, we propose Chain of Draft (CoD), a novel paradigm inspired by human cognitive processes, where LLMs generate minimalistic yet informative intermediate reasoning outputs while solving tasks. By reducing verbosity and focusing on critical insights, CoD matches or surpasses CoT in accuracy while using as little as only 7.6\% of the tokens, significantly reducing cost and latency across various reasoning tasks.

It requires complex reasoning to examine the model's errors, hypothesize what is missing or misleading in the current prompt, and communicate the task with clarity. While recent works indicate that large language models can be meta-prompted to perform automatic prompt engineering, we argue that their potential is limited due to insufficient guidance for complex reasoning in the meta-prompt. We fill this gap by infusing into the meta-prompt three key components: detailed descriptions, context specification, and a step-by-step reasoning template. The resulting method, named PE2, exhibits remarkable versatility across diverse language tasks. It finds prompts that outperform "let's think step by step" by 6.3\% on MultiArith and 3.1\% on GSM8K, and outperforms competitive baselines on counterfactual tasks by 6.9\%. Further, we show that PE2 can make targeted and highly specific prompt edits, rectify erroneous prompts, and induce multi-step plans for complex tasks.},

Thus, feedback and grading are often based on the results, which neglects the applied methods. However, gaining an understanding of students' approaches to complex projects could enhance comprehension of team success or failure. Our hypothesis is that there is a correlation between the consistency of the sprint plan and sprint review and the team’s overall performance in the competition. We introduce an approach to analyse the methodological effectiveness of student projects in their development approach. 70 student teams were requested to create a sprint plan at the start and a sprint review at the end of each of the five two-week iterative development sprints. The plan and review were based on four guiding questions for each sprint. A total of ten teams were examined, consisting of five high-performance and five low-performance teams. The teams were analysed quantitatively, and the consistency of sprint planning and sprint review was analysed qualitatively for one team from each group. Successful teams ran more tests and developed more prototypes and thus, delivered more profound results. The high-performance team formulated results clearer and more precisely and is more consistent throughout sprint plan and sprint review compared to the low-performance team.},

These queries require the LLM to produce code that invokes external APIs to answer the user's question, yet LLMs rarely produce correct code on the first try, requiring iterative code refinement upon execution results. In addition, using LLM assistants to support high query volumes can be expensive. In this work, we contribute a framework, EcoAssistant, that enables LLMs to answer code-driven queries more affordably and accurately. EcoAssistant contains three components. First, it allows the LLM assistants to converse with an automatic code executor to iteratively refine code or to produce answers based on the execution results. Second, we use a hierarchy of LLM assistants, which attempts to answer the query with weaker, cheaper LLMs before backing off to stronger, expensive ones. Third, we retrieve solutions from past successful queries as in-context demonstrations to help subsequent queries. Empirically, we show that EcoAssistant offers distinct advantages for affordability and accuracy, surpassing GPT-4 by 10 points of success rate with less than 50\% of GPT-4's cost.},

The MToM process, which involves interactive communication and ToM-based strategy adjustment, affects the team's performance and collaboration process. To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent's ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance.

Thus, VCS is very useful because it also supports a collaborative framework that makes it easy for software developers to work together effectively. Without VCS, collaboration is very challenging. This paper discusses the background and the related works about VCS that have been studied by researchers. The purpose of this paper is to convey the knowledge and ideas that have been established on VCS.},
