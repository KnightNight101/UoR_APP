      \field{abstract}{Are you serious about network security? Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections. It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively. Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution. How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is "transparent" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique "tunneling" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration. Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you're an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks. No matter where or how you're shipping information, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide will show you how to do it securely.}

      \field{abstract}{Kanban is a well-known agile method first implemented in Toyota's manufacturing process in the 1950s, later spreading across various industries and academic fields. It focuses on process and project improvement in different fields and emphasizes a team's ability to improve the efficiency of day-to-day activities by implementing the core practices (e.g., visualizing workflow, limiting work-in-progress, managing flow). The efficiency of day-to-day activities is crucial in every process, yet, recent times have called for a new out-of-the-box approach to address the challenges companies face. While the literature review presents efficiency improvements through the use of the core practices, one of the biggest problems while implementing Kanban is shown to be the setting of effective work-in-progress limits. This article addresses this issue and proves that the workflow does not exclusively depend on the work-in-progress limits---as the core practices suggest---but on determining the optimal relationship (solution) among the replenishment value, resource capacity, and work-in-progress limits. Such an approach ensures that the workflow pace on the Kanban board is sustainable by reducing the number of work items in queues as well as people's idleness. The proposed empirical approach runs a series of simulation scenarios aimed at helping to identify the optimal relationship among the three mentioned elements for generating a sustainable workflow pace and minimizing work/people's idleness.}

      \field{abstract}{Cloud computing services recently revolutionized the world. The rise of cloud systems, powered by Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, persuaded many companies, both large and small, that hosting their data in the cloud is more cost-effective, secure and convenient than maintaining an IT infrastructure on-premises. If you are still unsure which option---cloud versus on-premises---best fits your business needs, explore this comparison for computing, storage and database. This article could be handy for final decision-making. Both on-prem and cloud computing can provide your business with the IT infrastructure it needs. The final choice of the cloud versus on-premises model will likely depend on your business-specific use cases for data use and storage, the level of security required in order to meet compliance standards and the cost structure you prefer. The services modern cloud providers offer are cosmic. For instance, Amazon Web Services has a wide array of ready-to-use cloud computing solutions for an affordable price. So, what is the use of building your own rocket on-premises in case you can entrust its launch and management to an experienced space agency, aka cloud provider?}

      \field{abstract}{The fast rise of cloud computing during the last decade promised flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, for an increasing number of businesses, the long-term realities of cloud computing are requiring significant rethinking. According to recent studies, 42\% of US businesses have already moved at least half of their cloud workloads back on-premises or are planning to do so. The rising trend of "Cloud Exit" requires a thorough analysis of the cloud's disadvantages in comparison to its widely promoted benefits. Multiple critical variables are driving the shift away from total cloud reliance. Although transitioning to the cloud initially reduces building costs, subsequent operational expenses may ultimately surpass those of private data centers. A 2022 poll revealed that 43\% of IT leaders perceive the expenses associated with transitioning to the cloud as exceeding their initial expectations. Companies often contend with overprovisioning and surplus resources, resulting in unnecessary expenses. Simultaneously, notable cloud breaches at Capital One, Twilio, and others heighten apprehensions regarding the storage of sensitive data externally. Outages at AWS, Azure, and Oracle underscore dependence hazards. The Cloud Exit trend points to the need of a more balanced viewpoint. Although early adoption rates of clouds are strong, current polls reveal just 32\% of corporate cloud migrations are judged totally effective. The gap between the promised outcomes and real-world results suggests cloud computing has been overhyped. Its purported security, reliability, and cost advantages do not universally apply. Moreover, concentration among the "Big Three" cloud providers allows AWS, Azure, and Google inordinate influence over pricing, service terms, and the direction of innovation. Their supremacy and exclusive ecosystems progressively confine users, while unjustly disadvantaging third-party services. Consequently, an increasing number of firms are formulating Cloud Exit strategies to diminish external dependence, reclaim control, and manage dangers. The cloud necessitates ongoing assessment to maintain its competitive and financial viability over time, rather than being a universal solution. Preparedness to shift workloads off-cloud gives firms strategic flexibility. Rather than a one-way path, the cloud requires continuous reassessment. Exit is not failure, but strategic agility retaining on-premises control. With unchecked dependence, dominance and deviation from early claims, businesses are wise to temper cloud enthusiasm with realism. Maintaining hybrid flexibility and an exit strategy avoids innovation stagnation or lock-in. The cloud comedown does not negate its potential, only refocuses usage based on actual outcomes.}

      \field{abstract}{While intelligent virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have become ubiquitous in modern life, they still face limitations in their ability to follow multi-step instructions and accomplish complex goals articulated in natural language. However, recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) show promise for overcoming existing barriers by enhancing natural language processing and reasoning capabilities. Though promising, applying LLMs to create more advanced virtual assistants still faces challenges like ensuring robust performance and handling variability in real-world user commands. This paper proposes a novel LLM-based virtual assistant that can automatically perform multi-step operations within mobile apps based on high-level user requests. The system represents an advance in assistants by providing an end-to-end solution for parsing instructions, reasoning about goals, and executing actions. LLM-based Process Automation (LLMPA) has modules for decomposing instructions, generating descriptions, detecting interface elements, predicting next actions, and error checking. Experiments demonstrate the system completing complex mobile operation tasks in Alipay based on natural language instructions. This showcases how large language models can enable automated assistants to accomplish real-world tasks. The main contributions are the novel LLMPA architecture optimized for app process automation, the methodology for applying LLMs to mobile apps, and demonstrations of multi-step task completion in a real-world environment. Notably, this work represents the first real-world deployment and extensive evaluation of a large language model-based virtual assistant in a widely used mobile application with an enormous user base numbering in the hundreds of millions.}

      \field{abstract}{The paper is an analysis of the available project management methodologies from the standpoint of their applicability. Our aim is to establish specific characteristics of the today available methodologies (PMS, APM, PRINCE2, YUPMA, etc.) that can ensure realistic foundations on which an adequate methodology for a certain group of similar projects can be defined. The use of an adequate project management methodology brings a numerous advantages and benefits to project manager and project team and it shows them the right route towards project completion. This paper gives a review of the most recognizable methodologies proposed and implemented in the project management practice. Specific features of these methodologies were analysed bearing in mind the possibilities of implementation. It was found that general characteristics of traditional methodologies (PMI, IPMA, APM,YUPMA) make them more adequate to be implemented in larger and more complex projects such as: investment, military, manufacturing, overhaul, etc. projects. On the other hand, general characteristics of agile methodologies lead to a conclusion that these methodologies are more suitable to use for IT projects as well as for some smaller and less complex projects, such as devising various studies, project reports, etc. The research presented in this paper should be treated as a basis for further research oriented towards defining specific methodologies adequate for certain groups of similar projects.}

It is essential that teams have a good communication, motivation and concern about quality and client satisfaction, Agile Manufacturing is using Agile Project Management to provide the right team to performance difficult tasks and achieve goals. This paper proposes a team that deals with Agile Project Management, named as AGILE team, composed by a product owner, a team leader and team members, and a communication workflow proposal concerning the conjunction of 3 momentums (requirements analyze, planning and design) along the Agile Project Management. The proposed model is being implemented in a lightening manufacturing company in a very early stage.}

      \field{abstract}{Over recent years, the rising importance of knowledge work has prompted organizations to transition from traditional project management approaches to more collaborative methodologies. In today's globally connected environment, it is crucial for project managers to utilize a dynamic project management system that allows for swift and effective responses to emerging challenges and opportunities. Agile project management is recognized for its emphasis on decentralizing control and empowering team members to adapt to change. This article will explore and compare Agile Project Management with traditional project management techniques, highlighting historical practices and their relevance in the contemporary business landscape. Given the increasing complexity and unpredictability of today\textquoteright{}s projects, Agile Project Management has proven to be an invaluable asset for both knowledge workers and the project managers who oversee their efforts. This document aims to encourage the adoption of agile methodologies within the corporate sector, providing a comprehensive outline of the approach.}

      \field{abstract}{The rules and practices for Scrum---a simple process for managing complex projects---are few, straightforward, and easy to learn. But Scrum\textquoteright{}s simplicity itself---its lack of prescription---can be disarming, and new practitioners often find themselves reverting to old project management habits and tools and yielding lesser results. In this illuminating series of case studies, Scrum co-creator and evangelist Ken Schwaber identifies the real-world lessons---the successes and failures---culled from his years of experience coaching companies in agile project management. Through them, you\textquoteright{}ll understand how to use Scrum to solve complex problems and drive better results---delivering more valuable software faster. Gain the foundation in Scrum theory---and practice---you need to: Rein in even the most complex, unwieldy projects Effectively manage unknown or changing product requirements Simplify the chain of command with self-managing development teams Receive clearer specifications---and feedback---from customers Greatly reduce project planning time and required tools Build---and release---products in 30-day cycles so clients get deliverables earlier Avoid missteps by regularly inspecting, reporting on, and fine-tuning projects Support multiple teams working on a large-scale project from many geographic locations Maximize return on investment!}

      \field{abstract}{The Agile project management methodology has been widely used in recent years as a means to counter the dangers of traditional, front-end planning methods that often lead to downstream development pathologies. Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{This study seeks to illuminate the managerial tensions inherent in implementing scaled agile (on the organizational, top management, middle management and team levels) and to frame these challenges within the broader context of project management.,The study adopts a grounded theory approach and delves into a qualitative dataset sourced from 34 interviews with subject matter experts actively engaged in scaling agile initiatives within large organizations spanning various industries. Additionally, the data have been enriched through a comprehensive literature review of the existing body of knowledge on scaling agile.,As a result of our investigation, we propose a framework of managerial tensions in scaling agile in large corporate settings and a series of research propositions and questions that may contribute significantly to the body of knowledge surrounding the phenomenon of \textquotedblleft{}deprojectification\textquotedblright{} and propose agenda for the future studies in the field of project management.,The study also carries significant managerial implications. Firstly, based on the insights from the practice of scaling agile in large corporate setting, management can build awareness of the challenges inherent of transitioning to agile practices. This may help to anticipate the possible problems and proactively develop strategies how to address them. Secondly, management can be instructed about contingencies inherent in scaling agile, along with the potential disfunctions and side effects (unintended outcomes) that may emerge during the transition process. Thirdly, project management practitioners can gain insights on how scaling agile may cause shifts in the approach to managing projects, project team management and competencies that need to be developed to cope with environments where various approaches to managing projects coexist.,These insights can aid in the agile transition process, beginning with directing managerial attention toward contextual factors and progressing through potential challenges at the organizational, top management, middle management and team levels. Furthermore, the study highlights possible dysfunctionalities and side effects of scaling agile, shedding light on the \textquotedblleft{}dark side\textquotedblright{} of agile.,The study contributes to the expansion of the empirical database on the implementation of agile practices in large organizational settings. It plays a role in defining and delineating the phenomenon of scaling agile within the context of project management and outlines a research agenda for future project management studies. Additionally, our study adds to the ongoing discourse surrounding the \textquotedblleft{}deprojectification\textquotedblright{} effect that can occur during the scaling of agile. Lastly, it establishes connections between project management and software development literature regarding the implementation of agile at scale.}

      \field{abstract}{Sane programmers don't write production code without the help of an editor and an interpreter or a compiler, yet the author has seen many software projects limping along without using a version control system. We can explain this contrast if we think in terms of the increased start-up costs and delayed gratification associated with adopting a VCS. We humans typically discount the future, and therefore implementing version control in a project appears to be a fight against human nature. It's true that you can't beat the productivity boost that compilers and editors provide, but four decades after punched-card programming in assembly language has gone out of fashion, we must now look elsewhere for our next efficiency gains. And if you or your project isn't using a VCS, adopting one might well be the single most important tooling improvement you can undertake.}

      \field{abstract}{Docker is an open platform product that can package an application and its dependencies inside a virtual container and this technology is called as container technology. Those packages can be build, ship and run inside distributed environments by developers or system administrators with ease. This technology offers huge advantages for enterprises with new kind of portability, scalability, speed, delivery and maintenance. This thesis focused on the advantage side of Docker container technology. Differences between virtualization and container technology were examined from several levels which included usability, benefits, disadvantages, risks and performance. The aim of the study was to investigate has Docker all those advantages it is hyped for and is there negative sides in this technology. The most important observation of this study is that Docker has many potential advantages in the fields of usability, performance and security against traditional virtualization. The research was executed as a literature review with some own conclusions. Keywords: docker, virtualization, container, container-technology, performance, advantages, security}

      \field{abstract}{With the increasing scale of systems and products, many large companies ask different suppliers to manufacture the components of the final systems or products. Thus, managing projects dedicated to complex systems engineering is very tricky and ensuring the success of projects is a real issue. Many project management tools, techniques and even standards or guides have been developed by different organizations in order to support the management of such projects. For project managers, selecting and relying on immediately operational methods, tools and references (standards and guides) for a project manager to lead his project represents a true difficulty. The purpose of this paper is to introduce, analyze and compare the most famous project management references (PMBoK, ISO 21500 and ISO/IEC 29110) to provide a global and a detailed views on project management methodological guidelines, in order to facilitate the choice of a project management reference to help the project manager to manage the project effectively, thus to improve the success rate of projects.}
