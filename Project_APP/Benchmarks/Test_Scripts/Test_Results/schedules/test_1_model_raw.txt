Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this sprint planning problem step by step. I see we have seven tasks with different do and verify durations, plus some dependencies to consider. The team has two members each working up to four hours a day.

First, I need to understand how task duration is calculated - it says combine do+verify into one contiguous block. So for Task 0 (do:8, verify:4), that would be a total of 12 hours per assignment. 

Looking at the dependencies list, only Task 4 depends on Task 1, which means Task 4 can't start until Task 1 is done. All other tasks seem independent.

I should probably assign similar duration tasks together to balance workload. Let me sort them by duration: Tasks 0 (12h), 5 (6h), 4&6 (7h each), then 1+3 (8h and 3h respectively), finally Task 2 (5h).

Since member_0 is available for 4 hours daily, they'll need more days to complete longer tasks. Maybe assign the big 12-hour task to them first since it's straightforward without dependencies.

Member_1 could take Task 5 which needs review but no dependency issues. Then we can split Tasks 4 and 6 - both require 7 hours including verification, so assigning one per day makes sense.

Tasks 1 and 3 don't depend on each other, so they can be worked in parallel by member_0 with the remaining time after Task 2 is done.

The key here is respecting dependencies while keeping track of daily availability. Need to make sure start times align properly - like Task 4 must wait until Task 1 completion.
...done thinking.
