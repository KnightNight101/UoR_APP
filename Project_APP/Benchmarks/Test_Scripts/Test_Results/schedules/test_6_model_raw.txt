Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this sprint planning problem step by step. The user wants me to create a detailed plan for four tasks with specific durations and dependencies, assigning them to two team members (each working up to 4 hours per day). 

First, I need to understand the constraints clearly: Each member has only 4 available hours daily, so their total capacity is limited based on how many days they can work. The output should follow a strict schema with task IDs and assignment details.

Looking at Task_0: It requires 6+4=10 hours without dependencies. Since there are two members, it makes sense to split this evenly - each works half the time (5 hours). But wait, how many days does that take? At 4 hours per day, one member would need ceil(5/4)=2 days for their share. 

Then comes Task_1: It depends on Task_0 and needs 8 hours total (5+3). This must start after Task_0 ends. Similarly, Task_2 is independent but also requires 7 hours (3+4), so it can run in parallel with Task_1 if needed.

The most complex part is Task_3 which depends on both Task_1 and Task_2 and needs 7 hours total (5+2). We'll need to calculate the earliest start time based on predecessor completion times while respecting daily hour limits. 

I should consider how to model task execution - since durations are split across days, I might need to track cumulative hours per member and ensure no day exceeds their capacity. The dependencies create a critical path that will determine when Task_3 can actually begin.

Hmm... the example shows assigning one task entirely to a single member for 8 hours in two days. But with four tasks and two members, we'll have overlapping work periods where careful scheduling becomes essential to avoid overloading any particular day.

Let me think about possible approaches: One way is to schedule independent tasks first across different days until dependencies force sequential execution. The key will be aligning start times so that dependent tasks begin only after their prerequisites are fully completed by the respective team members.
...done thinking.

```json

      "assignee": "member_1",  
      **"start": 48.0,**  
      **"duration": 3.0**
    },
    {
      "task_id": 3,  
      "assignee": "member_0",  
      **"start": 56.0,**  
      **"duration": 2.0** 
    },  
    {  
      "task_id": 3,  
      "assignee": "member_1",  
      **"start": 56.0,**

    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Task_0** is split across two members (each working up to 4 hours per day). It requires a total of 10 hours (`do` = 6 + `verify` = 4).  
  - Each member works on Task_0 for half the time: `member_0` takes 5 hours and `member_1` takes 5 hours (splitting to respect daily available hours).

- **Task_1** depends on Task_0. It requires a total of 8 hours (`do` = 5 + `verify` = 3).  
  - Since Task_0 is completed by both members at different times, the start time for Task_1 is set after the last member finishes Task_0.

- **Task_2** has no dependencies but requires a total of 7 hours (`do` = 3 + `verify` = 4).  
  - It can run in parallel with other tasks except when constrained by shared resources or dependencies.  

- **Task_3** depends on both Task_1 and Task_2, so it starts only after the last member finishes both dependent tasks.  
  - The duration is split evenly across members: `member_0` takes 3 hours (half of the total) and `member_1` takes 4 hours (the other half).
