Thinking...
Okay, let me tackle this sprint planning problem step by step. The user wants a detailed schedule for multiple tasks with dependencies, assigning them to two team members (8 hours/day and 6 hours/day) while ensuring that the "do" and "verify" phases are contiguous.

First, I need to understand all the dependencies between tasks. Task_2 depends on Task_1, so Task_1 must finish before Task_2 starts. Tasks associated with parent Task_4 (Task_4_sub0 and Task_4_sub1) can be scheduled independently since they don't depend on each other or have ordering requirements specified.

The total available hours per day from both team members need to match the cumulative task durations while respecting dependencies. Looking at all tasks, there are 38 hours of work needed across different days, so we'll need at least two full days (member_0 has 16 hours and member_1 has 12).

For Task_7 which depends on Task_3, I should schedule it after Task_3's verification. Since Task_4_sub tasks can be done in parallel with their parent once ready, they could potentially overlap across different team members' days.

I'll need to carefully assign these task blocks while making sure the dependencies are respected and that no one exceeds their daily availability limits.
...done thinking.
