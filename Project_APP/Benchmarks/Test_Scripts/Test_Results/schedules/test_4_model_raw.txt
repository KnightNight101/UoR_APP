Thinking...
Okay, let me look at this scheduling problem carefully. The user has provided a JSON structure with three team members having capacities (8/4/8), seven tasks with different durations and dependencies, and some notes about respecting task order and combining work phases.

Hmm, the note mentions that do+verify should be combined into one contiguous block - that's interesting because many projects split these phases but here they want everything in sequence. I need to design a schedule where all tasks' "do" happens before their "verify". 

Let me break this down systematically. First, there are no dependencies between tasks except for the parent-child relationships mentioned explicitly (like Task_3_sub0 being child of Task_3). That means we can treat them as independent chains.

The time complexity here is O(n) since each task has fixed duration requirements and no complex inter-task constraints beyond simple precedence. I'm thinking about how to model this efficiently - probably a greedy approach would work best because tasks don't have conflicting resource needs except for the team members' daily limits.

For the durations, all "do" hours are specified first then "verify". The key constraint is that team members can't exceed their capacity across any time period. Since we're combining do+verify into one block per task, I need to ensure this doesn't violate anyone's availability.

I should start by assigning tasks to days in a way that minimizes idle time while respecting the member capacities and task precedence rules. The total work required is significant - let me calculate: 8 + 4 + 8 for members gives daily capacity of at least 20 hours, but with varying task durations it's more complex.

Each task has both do and verify requirements that need to be sequentialized properly. I'll need to track team member availability across the timeline carefully to avoid overbooking anyone.
...done thinking.

Okay, let me analyze this scheduling problem step by step based on the provided data:

**Team:**
*   **member_0:** Daily capacity = 8 hours
*   **member_1:** Daily capacity = 4 hours
*   **member_2:** Daily capacity = 8 hours

**Tasks:**

| ID      | Title           | Do (hrs) | Verify (hrs) | Total Hrs | Parent Task |
| :------ | :--------------- | -------: | ---------: | --------: | ----------: |
| 0       | Task_0          | 6        | 4         | 10        | null        |
| 1       | Task_0_sub0     | 3        | 2         | 5         | 0           |
| 2       | Task_1          | 6        | 3         | 9         | null        |
| 3       | Task_2          | 5        | 2         | 7         | null        |
| 4       | Task_3          | 8        | 3         | 11        | null        |
| 5       | Task_3_sub0     | 4        | 1         | 5         | 3           |
| 6       | Task_3_sub1     | 4        | 1         | 5         | 3           |
| 7       | Task_4          | 3        | 3         | 6         | null        |
| 8       | Task_5          | 3        | 4         | 7         | null        |

**Key Constraints:**

1.  **Task Dependencies:** Tasks must finish before their children start (e.g., Task_0 finishes before Task_0_sub0 starts). This forms a dependency chain.
2.  **Member Capacity:** No member can work more hours than their daily capacity on any single day or over the period covered by the schedule.
3.  **Do+Verify Contiguity:** For each task, all its "do" hours must be worked consecutively before starting the "verify" phase.

**Analysis:**

*   The total required "hours" (sum of do + verify) for all tasks is `10 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 11 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 65` hours.
*   There are three team members, so the combined daily capacity can be up to `(8+4+8)=20` hours per day (if all work every day). However, tasks require sequential focus for each member.

**Approach:**

We need to schedule the "do" and "verify" blocks sequentially for each task while ensuring that no team member is overloaded on any given day. We can think of this as assigning time slots ("Do" block duration) followed by assignment slots ("Verify" block duration).

Let's start with Task_0 (ID: 0):

*   **Task_0 Do:** Requires `6` hours.
*   **Task_0 Verify:** Requires `4` hours.

We can assign these to consecutive days or within the same period, ensuring no member exceeds their capacity during those days. For example:

Day 1-2: Task_0 Do (e.g., `member_0`: 8 hrs/day * ~0.75 day ≈ needs ~3 days if spread thin, but ideally we keep blocks contiguous). Let's optimize for fewer days.

**Efficient Schedule Attempt (Conceptual):**

We aim to minimize the total schedule duration while respecting capacities and dependencies.

*   Start with Task_1 (ID: 2) which has a high do requirement (`6`). It can take two full days by `member_0` (8 hrs/day * 2 = 16 hours, but needs only 6 + 3 verify).
*   Schedule Task_4 and Task_5 together since they have similar durations. `member_2` could work on both.
    *   Task_4 Do (`3`) + Task_5 Do (`3`) requires a day with at least `(8+4)=12` hours available, say by `member_0`.
    *   Task_4 Verify (`3`) + Task_5 Verify (`4`) requires another day with capacity.
*   Schedule the main tasks and their subtasks sequentially.

**Potential Solution Outline:**

Based on the calculations, here's a possible schedule:

*   **Days 1-2:** Task_0 Do (e.g., `member_0`: 8 hrs/day * 2 days = 16 hours > 6 needed)
    *   *Within Day 1:* `Task_4 Do`, `Task_5 Do` might fit alongside other tasks if capacity allows.
*   **Days 3-5:** Task_1 Do (e.g., `member_0`: 8 hrs/day * ~2.5 days ≈ needs 2 full and part of a third day, but let's be efficient)
    *   *Within Days 3-5:* `Task_4 Verify`, `Task_5 Verify` might fit alongside other tasks if capacity allows.
*   **Days 6-7:** Task_2 Do (e.g., `member_0`: 8 hrs/day * ~1 day needed, but can be split across days)
    *   *Within Days 6-7:* Other task verifies or do phases might fit.
*   **Day 8+ (if needed):** Handle remaining capacity for Task_3 Do/Verify and other tasks.

I need to work out the exact assignment considering all constraints. The final schedule should assign specific days and team members, ensuring no overbooking occurs at any point.
