Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this sprint planning problem. The user wants me to create a detailed plan for several tasks considering dependencies and team availability. They've provided specific constraints like daily hours per member (8,6,8) and the need to combine "do" and "verify" into contiguous blocks.

First, I notice there are parent-child relationships among tasks through dependencies. Tasks 3 and 4 have a parent task of null initially but then get subtasks assigned later. This suggests we need to consider hierarchical structures where main tasks must be completed before their subtasks can start. 

I should prioritize the critical path - Task_5 depends on both Task_1 and Task_3, while Task_8 is a direct dependency for Task_4_sub0. Let me map out all dependencies... Ah right, Task_2 requires Task_1 done first. Then Tasks 3 and 4 depend on Task_2. Task_4_sub0's do phase depends on both Task_0 and Task_2.

The example shows a simple case with just one task assigned to member_0 for the entire sprint duration (8 hours). But our tasks have varying durations - let's calculate total work time: 7 + 4 + 5 + 3 = Wait no, that doesn't account for dependencies. Actually Task_2 is part of both parent and child paths.

Hmm, I need to sequence tasks properly. Let me start with independent tasks first... The user didn't specify any priorities beyond respecting dependencies. Maybe we should assign multiple team members if possible without overlapping critical path items.

Wait, looking at durations: Task_0 takes 5 hours (3+2), similar for others. With daily limits of 8/6/8, some tasks might need to be split across days or distributed to different members depending on their dependencies. 

I see that the output schema requires task_id as integer but in examples it's shown as string sometimes? Better keep consistent with the instructions' format.

The main challenge is ensuring all dependencies are satisfied before assigning a task while maximizing team utilization. Need to schedule tasks so no one starts something until its prerequisites are done.
...done thinking.
