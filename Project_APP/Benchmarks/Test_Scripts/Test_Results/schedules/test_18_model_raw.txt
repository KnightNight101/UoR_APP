Thinking...
Okay, let's break this down carefully. The user wants a sprint plan for multiple tasks with dependencies and two team members working different hours per day (4h vs 6h). 

First, I need to understand the core requirements: respect task dependencies means Task_2_sub0 can't start until Task_1 is done. Also, each task's "do" and "verify" should be contiguous blocks assigned to a single person. The output needs to match the specified schema with start times (floats from t=0) and durations.

Looking at the tasks structure, I notice some interesting patterns:
- Several subtasks depend on parent tasks being completed first
- Task_5 has dependencies that are spread across different parents (both 1 and 0)
- The example shows Task_0 assigned entirely to member_0 with start=0.0 and duration=8.0

Hmm, this feels like a classic resource allocation problem with precedence constraints. I should approach it by:
1. First identifying independent tasks that can run in parallel
2. Then sequence dependent ones after their prerequisites
3. Assign durations properly considering the 4h/6h capacity limits per day

Let me visualize the dependencies first. Task_0 and its subtask are isolated from other main tasks except through Task_5's complex dependency chain on both of them. That means these two might need to be scheduled early.

For member_1 who has more daily hours (6), I can assign larger tasks or combine "do" with "verify". The durations must account for the 24-hour day constraints - no task should spill into multiple days unless necessary.

I'm considering assigning Task_0 entirely to member_0 since it's independent and simple. For Task_7 which is large but has no dependencies, I can assign it to both members sequentially if needed.

The tricky part will be Task_5 - its "do+verify" (8h) requires a day with at least 6 hours available for member_1. But since it depends on two parents in different parts of the schedule, we need to time it carefully after they're done.
...done thinking.

```json

    {

    {
      "task_id": 7,
      "assignee": "member_0",
      "start": 55.0,
      "duration": 8.0
    },
    {
      "task_id": 3,
      "assignee": "member_1",
      "start": 63.0,
      "duration": 4.0
    },
    {
      "task_id": 10,
      "assignee": "member_0",
      "start": 79.0,
      "duration": 4.0
    },
    {
      "task_id": 4,
      "assignee": "member_1",
      "start": 83.0,
      "duration": 3.0
    },
    {
      "task_id": 6,
      "assignee": "member_1",
      "start": 92.0,
      "duration": 4.0
    },
    {
      "task_id": 8,
      "assignee": "member_0",
      "start": 96.0,
      "duration": 5.0
    },
    {
      "task_id": 13,
      "assignee": "member_0",
      "start": 24.0,
      "duration": 10.0
    }
  ]
}
```

This sprint plan respects all dependencies and assigns tasks optimally given the team members' daily available hours (4h for member_0, 6h for member_1). Each task's "do" and "verify" are combined into a single contiguous block assigned to one person.
