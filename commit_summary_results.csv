1,Added function to calculate factorial,Add factorial function,"Thinking...
Hmm, the user wants me to act as a git commit summarizer. They've provided a simple diff that states ""Added function to calculate factorial"" and they want just a concise commit message in JSON format.

I notice they're very specific about wanting only the JSON output with two fields: commit_msg and thoughts. The commit_msg should be brief, while thoughts can provide additional context but shouldn't exceed 20 words according to their instructions.

For this diff, it's straightforward - someone added a factorial calculation function. I'll keep the commit message concise by simply saying ""Add factorial function"" since that captures the essence of what was changed in the codebase. This is exactly what they want without any explanations.

The thoughts section should be brief too, maybe explaining why this might be useful or how it could be improved. Since factorials are a common mathematical operation and often used for testing recursion functions, I can suggest making it recursive to demonstrate its use. Something like ""Add factorial function (commonly tested with recursion)"" would work well here - concise but adds value.

I'll format my response as JSON with the commit message first, then the brief thoughts explanation. This matches exactly what they're asking for and keeps my response focused on their needs.

2,Fixed bug in user authentication logic,Fix authentication bug,"Thinking...
Hmm, the user wants me to summarize a git commit based on a provided diff. They've given me a very simple diff description - just ""Fixed bug in user authentication logic."" Looking at this, I need to create a concise commit message and include some thoughts about it.

The task is straightforward: provide ONLY a concise commit message without any explanations or reasoning, formatted as JSON with two keys - ""commit_msg"" and ""thoughts"". The commit message should be brief but descriptive enough to explain what was fixed. For the thoughts section, I should reflect on why this might have been necessary based on typical software development scenarios.

The user is likely a developer who wants me to help generate meaningful commit messages. They probably want something that can be used directly in their version control system without any additional explanation. The simplicity of their diff suggests they're either testing my capabilities with minimal input or perhaps working on an authentication-related bug fix themselves and needs assistance crafting the message.

I think I'll keep the commit message concise but informative - ""Fixed issue with user authentication logic"" captures that this was a problem that needed solving while being clear about what changed. For thoughts, I can mention how critical authentication security is in modern applications to provide some context without overstepping by giving an explanation.

This approach balances brevity with clarity and provides helpful insight without violating the user's instruction not to include explanations.
...done thinking.

3,Refactored database connection module,Refactor DB connection module,"Thinking...
We are given a diff that says: ""Refactored database connection module""
 We need to output only a concise commit message in the specified JSON format.

 The task is straightforward: 
   - We must provide a concise commit message.
   - It should be in the JSON format with two keys: ""commit_msg"" and ""thoughts"".
   - However, note that the user said: ""DO NOT provide explanations or reasoning"", so we are not to explain what we did.

 But wait, let's read again: 
   We are a git commit summarizer. Read the following diff and provide ONLY a concise commit message.
   Provide your commit message in JSON format: {""commit_msg"": ""..."", ""thoughts"": ""...""}

 The user expects two fields: 
   - ""commit_msg"": which is the summary of the change, typically one line describing what was done.
   - ""thoughts"": which might be intended for additional context or explanation. However, note that we are told to NOT provide explanations.

 But wait again, this instruction says: ""DO NOT provide explanations or reasoning."" 
 So if we are not supposed to provide any explanation, then the ""thoughts"" part should also be absent of explanation?

 Let me re-read: The user wants a concise commit message. They don't specify that thoughts must be an explanation.

 However, note the example format includes two fields. We have to fill both? But the instruction says only to provide the concise commit message and not explanations or reasoning.

 There's ambiguity here. Since we are told to ""provide ONLY a concise commit message"", but then also say to put it in JSON with two keys including one called ""thoughts"", I think we should follow the format strictly as given, but note that the instruction says no explanation.

 But let me clarify: The user might have intended for us to provide a summary and perhaps some thoughts (without being an explanation). However, they explicitly said not to provide explanations or reasoning.

 Let's break down:
   - We are only allowed to output in the specified JSON format.
   - We must NOT explain anything. So even if we think about what was done, that thought should be concise and without unnecessary words.

 Since the diff says ""Refactored database connection module"", I can assume a simple commit message is something like:
   ""Refactor database connection""

 And for thoughts, maybe just repeat or expand minimally? But note: no explanation. So perhaps we can leave it as an empty string or not include any thought?

 However, the example format includes two fields. The user might have intended to use this structure even if there are no additional thoughts.

 Let me stick to the requirement of being concise and without explanations, so I'll keep both parts very minimal.

 But wait again: the instruction says ""DO NOT provide explanations or reasoning"", meaning that we cannot write any text that explains or reasons. So in the commit message itself, we should avoid long descriptions because they might be considered as thoughts (explanation). 

 However, note that a concise commit message is typically one line and does not require explanation.

 Since the diff only says ""Refactored database connection module"", I can assume:

   commit_msg: ""Refactor database connection""
   thoughts: We are to avoid any explanation. Maybe leave it as an empty string? Or perhaps just say what was done without going into why?

 But note, the user did not specify that we should have two fields and what each does beyond the name.

 Alternatively, maybe the user wants us to generate a commit message in the format of:

   {""commit_msg"": ""A concise summary"", ""thoughts"": ""Any brief additional information (not explanation)""}

 However, without explicit instructions on thoughts, I think it's safe to just provide a one-line commit_msg and an empty string for thoughts? 

 But wait, let me check: The user said to read the diff and provide ONLY a concise commit message. Then they specified the JSON format with two keys.

 Since we are only allowed to output in that format, we must include both keys even if thoughts is just an empty string?

 However, note that the instruction says ""DO NOT provide explanations or reasoning"". We can use the thoughts field for any non-explanatory thought? 

 But I think it's better to be safe and stick closely to what was asked. The diff says there was a refactoring of the database connection module.

 Let me propose:

   commit_msg: ""Refactor db connection""
   thoughts: """" (empty string)

 Alternatively, perhaps we can put in the thoughts field some minimal description that is part of the refactor? But without explanation, so just what?

 Since the instruction says not to provide explanations, I think the safest is to keep it very short.

 However, let's consider: The commit message should be clear and concise. And if there are any additional thoughts (like changes in functionality or why), that would be an explanation. So we avoid that.

 But note, sometimes a refactor might change behavior? Then we need to document the change. However, without more context from the diff, I cannot know.

 The given diff is just one line: ""Refactored database connection module""

 Therefore, I will output:

   {""commit_msg"": ""Refactor database connection"", ""thoughts"": """"}

 But wait, maybe the thoughts field can be used to indicate that this commit is a refactor? Or perhaps nothing?

 Alternatively, let me think about what git commit messages typically look like. They are usually in the present tense and very short.

 Since we don't have more information, I'll stick with:

   {""commit_msg"": ""Refactor database connection module"", ""thoughts"": """"}

 However, note that the diff description is exactly: ""Refactored database connection module""

 We can use that as the commit message? But it's in past tense. Typically git uses present tense.

 Let me change to present tense:

   {""commit_msg"": ""Refactor database connection"", ""thoughts"": """"}

 But wait, the original diff says ""Refactored"", which is a bit more detailed. However, if we are being concise, then just say ""Refactor db"".

 Considering common practices and conciseness, I'll go with:

   commit_msg: ""Refactor db connection""

 Let me write it accordingly.

 Final decision:
...done thinking.

4,Updated README with installation instructions,Update README with install guide,"Thinking...
Hmm, the user wants me to act as a git commit summarizer. They've provided a diff showing that someone updated the README file with installation instructions and asked for ONLY a concise commit message in JSON format.

I need to understand this request clearly: it's straightforward—just summarize the change without any extra details or explanations. The key is to be brief, professional, and directly reflect what was done in the code update.

The diff says ""Updated README with installation instructions."" That's clear—it's about modifying the README file to add how-to guides. My response should capture this essence in a commit message format.

Now, thinking about the JSON structure: the user specified {""commit_msg"": ""..."", ""thoughts"": ""...""}. I have to include both fields, but keep them concise. For ""commit_msg,"" it's simple; based on standard git practices, something like ""Add installation instructions to README"" would be appropriate because it clearly states the action and purpose.

For ""thoughts,"" this is a bit trickier. The user didn't ask for analysis, just a concise commit message, but they included an option for thoughts. I should consider what might help here—perhaps ensuring the message aligns with best practices or thinking about why such updates matter in team collaboration.

But remember, my role is to be helpful and accurate. If ""thoughts"" isn't required by the user's instruction, I shouldn't force it unless they ask. In this case, since they said ""DO NOT provide explanations,"" I'll keep thoughts minimal if needed for completeness.

Finally, formatting: output must be pure JSON with no extra text. So my response will be exactly {""commit_msg"": ""..."", ""thoughts"": ""...""}, making sure it's valid and concise to meet the user's needs.

5,Removed deprecated login API endpoints,Remove deprecated login endpoints,"Thinking...
Okay, user wants me to summarize a Git commit based on a given diff. They're very specific about the format - just a concise commit message in JSON with two fields. No explanations needed at all.

Hmm, looking at the diff content... it says ""Removed deprecated login API endpoints"". That's pretty straightforward. The user is clearly showing they removed some old authentication methods from their API.

The request is simple but precise: only the commit summary and thoughts in JSON format, nothing else. User probably needs this for automated processing or integration with something. They're being very technical here.

Let me think about how to structure this response... The commit message should be short and clear - just ""Removed deprecated login API endpoints"" seems perfect since that's exactly what the diff says. 

For thoughts, I need to keep it brief too. Maybe focus on why they might have done this removal? Probably because these features are no longer supported or used in new versions. Should mention their intention was to remove outdated functionality.

User didn't specify how much detail they want in thoughts, so keeping it concise but informative makes sense. The JSON format is strict - needs the exact keys and structure they requested.

This seems like a developer working on API maintenance who wants quick summaries for some tool or documentation purpose. They know exactly what they need from me - pure data with no fluff.
