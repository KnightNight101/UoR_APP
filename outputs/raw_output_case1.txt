In this plan, each task is assigned to its corresponding team member and has the correct start and end dates, taking into account dependencies and durations.
Task A starts on Monday (Sprint Start) at 9am and takes up all of Monday's working hours.
Task B depends on Task A and can only start after it has finished. It takes 4 hours to complete, so it runs from Tuesday morning till just before lunch.
Task C depends on Task B and also follows the same pattern of starting immediately after its dependency finishes.
Each task is assigned to a team member with the highest capacity for their respective dependencies.
