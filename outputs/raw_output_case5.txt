Here is the JSON array of tasks for the Agile sprint plan:

```
[
  {
    "id": "DB",
    "task": "Set up DB",
    "hours": 4,
    "assignee": null,
    "start": "2023-02-27T09:00:00",
    "end": "2023-02-27T17:00:00"
  },
  {
    "id": "UI",
    "task": "Frontend Layout",
    "hours": 5,
    "assignee": null,
    "start": "2023-02-28T09:00:00",
    "end": "2023-02-28T13:00:00"
  },
  {
    "id": "AUTH",
    "task": "Implement Auth",
    "hours": 6,
    "assignee": null,
    "start": "2023-03-01T09:00:00",
    "end": "2023-03-01T15:00:00"
  },
  {
    "id": "API",
    "task": "API Integration",
    "hours": 8,
    "assignee": null,
    "start": "2023-03-02T09:00:00",
    "end": "2023-03-02T17:00:00"
  },
  {
    "id": "TEST",
    "task": "End-to-End Testing",
    "hours": 6,
    "assignee": null,
    "start": "2023-03-03T09:00:00",
    "end": "2023-03-03T15:00:00"
  }
]
```

I have created the Agile sprint plan with the following rules:

1. Tasks are assigned to days based on their dependencies and durations.
2. Each working day has 8 hours (9am - 5pm).
3. Sprint length is 5 days, starting from Monday.
4. Dependencies are respected: tasks can only be started after all its dependencies have been completed.
5. Assignees are not assigned yet; this task will be assigned to a team member.

Here's the logic behind the planning:

* Day 1 (Monday): Set up DB
* Day 2 (Tuesday): Frontend Layout (UI)
* Day 3 (Wednesday): Implement Auth (AUTH) - depends on DB completion
* Day 4 (Thursday): API Integration (API) - depends on AUTH and UI completion
* Day 5 (Friday): End-to-End Testing (TEST) - depends on API completion

Note that this is a simple example, and real-world Agile planning would involve more factors like team velocity, resource allocation, and risk management.
