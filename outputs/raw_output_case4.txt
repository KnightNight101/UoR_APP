This sprint plan starts on Monday (February 5th) at 9am and has a length of five days, with each working day consisting of eight hours. The tasks are assigned to John Doe and Jane Doe as required by the input data. 

Please note that these tasks assume no breaks during the workday, which is not realistic in many environments. You might want to add some buffer time between tasks for breaks.
