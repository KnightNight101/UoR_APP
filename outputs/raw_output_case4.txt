The tasks are assigned as follows:

* D1 is assigned to John Doe on Monday (2023-09-04) from 9am to 5pm.
* D2 is assigned to Jane Doe on Tuesday (2023-09-05) from 9am to 1pm.
* D3 is assigned to John Doe on Wednesday (2023-09-06) from 9am to 11am.

The assignments were made by checking the dependencies and assigning tasks in order of their dependencies. The first task with no dependencies was assigned to the team member with the earliest available time slot, who in this case is John Doe on Monday. The second task (D2) was assigned to Jane Doe as she has no other tasks assigned during her availability. Finally, D3 was assigned back to John Doe after completing D1 and having enough time before Wednesday.
