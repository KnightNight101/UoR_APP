Here's the step-by-step solution to create the Agile sprint plan:

1. **Sort tasks by duration**:
   Sort the tasks in descending order of their durations so that we can start with the longest task and assign it to the first day.

2. **Assign tasks for each working day**:
   For a 5-day sprint, starting on Monday at 9 AM and considering 8 hours per day, we need to assign tasks accordingly.
   
3. **Assign tasks for Day 1 (Monday)**:
   Since Monday is already occupied with task D, which has an assignment for Alice, we'll keep it as is.

4. **Assign tasks for Day 2 (Tuesday)**:
   We have assigned Task E to Bob on Tuesday. Now, there's no more space available for the remaining tasks (F) during this day because Task F is dependent on both Tasks D and E which are already placed on Days 1 and 2 respectively.

5. **Assign tasks for Day 3 (Wednesday)**:
   Since all the tasks from Monday to Tuesday have been assigned, we now move to Wednesday and place task F here as it's only dependent on Task D which is already done by then.
