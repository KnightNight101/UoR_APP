```json
[
  {
    "id": "X",
    "task": "Task X",
    "hours": 10,
    "assignee": "Alice",
    "start": "Monday 9:00 AM",
    "end": "Tuesday 5:00 PM"
  },
  {
    "id": "Y",
    "task": "Task Y",
    "hours": 8,
    "assignee": "Alice",
    "start": "Tuesday 9:00 AM",
    "end": "Wednesday 5:00 PM"
  },
  {
    "id": "Z",
    "task": "Task Z",
    "hours": 6,
    "assignee": "Bob",
    "start": "Thursday 9:00 AM",
    "end": "Friday 3:00 PM"
  }
]
```

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

1. We start with the dependencies, so we schedule `Task X` first since it has no dependencies.
2. Then we schedule `Task Y`, but only after `Task X` is done (i.e., its end date). This way, `Task Y` can be scheduled on Tuesday afternoon.
3. Finally, we schedule `Task Z`. Since it depends on `Task Y`, it will start on Wednesday afternoon.

I've assigned tasks to individuals based on the `assigned_to` field in the input data. Note that I assumed the sprint length is 5 days (Monday to Friday), and each working day has 8 hours of work, from 9am to 5pm.
